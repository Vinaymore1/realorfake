Prime of India is Modi,"UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has met US President Donald Trump during his first visit to the White House.
Here are some of the key moments as the pair took questions from reporters before and after the talks.
Sir Keir did not turn up to the meeting empty-handed.
Part way through their opening remarks, the prime minister reached inside his jacket pocket and pulled out an official letter from King Charles III - an invitation for a second state visit.
Trump appeared to be genuinely taken back for a few seconds, asking: ""Am I supposed to read it right now?""
After taking a minute to read the letter, Trump said he accepted the invite and that it would be an ""honour"" to visit the ""fantastic"" country.
He added that King Charles was a ""beautiful man, a wonderful man"".
During Trump's first term as president, he met King Charles's mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, during a three-day state visit in 2019.
Sir Keir said Thursday's invitation to host Trump once more for a second full state visit was ""unprecedented"".
While cordial, the initial meeting in the Oval Office between Sir Keir and Trump left no doubt that the US president hoped to be firmly in charge.
The meeting was a pattern we've now seen six times with foreign leaders at the Trump White House, including with French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this week: Trump taking control of the room and using the opportunity to get his own messages, both domestic and international, across to the reporters there.
During their half-hour session, Trump leaned forward and slightly towards Sir Keir - wearing a nearly identical, but slightly different coloured tie to Trump's - dominating the conversation and taking charge of calling on reporters.
A joint afternoon news conference later began with a slightly more diplomatic and matter-of-fact tone, with both Trump and Sir Keir standing at their respective lecterns and going to considerable lengths to lavish praise on the other.
Trump joked he would have been president 20 years ago with Sir Keir's ""beautiful"" accent.
At one point, Sir Keir was asked about Trump's controversial call to make Canada – a member of the Commonwealth – the 51st state of the US.
""I think you're trying to find a divide that doesn't exist,"" Sir Keir replied.
Trump interjected quickly with the words ""that's enough"" before moving on – again taking control of the room as he stood next to a visibly surprised Sir Keir.
To put it gently, Sir Keir and Trump are from different schools of politics - both in their style and substance.
But asked to name their similarities Trump said: ""He loves his country, and so do I.""
What else do they share? Trump said ""we like each other, frankly, and we like each other's country"".
But the ""common thread"" between the two men was that ""we love our country"", Trump said.
Sir Keir had a number of tricky topics to raise with Trump - from trade to US security guarantees for Ukraine - and at the beginning of their news conference he called his counterpart ""a very tough negotiator"".
Asked if the prime minister had convinced him not to impose trade tariffs on the UK, Trump said ""he tried"", adding: ""He was working hard, I'll tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there.""
But he has said there was ""a very good chance"" of a trade deal ""where tariffs wouldn't be necessary"".
Such a deal, Trump said, could be made ""pretty quickly"".
Sir Keir spoke of a ""new economic deal with advanced technology at its core"".
Trump said he was ""inclined to go along with"" the UK's Chagos Islands deal.
The UK is in talks with Mauritius about handing over the territory but continuing to lease one of the islands, Diego Garcia, which contains a UK-US military airbase.
The agreement has been mired in uncertainty after Trump's re-election as US president, given several US Republicans have argued it could deliver a potential security boost to China.
But during the meeting, Trump said he had a ""feeling"" the deal was going to ""work out very well"".
Last week, Trump made headlines by calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a ""dictator"" in a social media post, echoing Russian claims about Kyiv's cancelled elections.
An election was scheduled for May 2024, but it was suspended because Ukraine has been under martial law since Russia began its full-scale invasion.
Asked by the BBC's Chris Mason about his use of the word ""dictator"", Trump replied: ""Did I say that? I can't believe I would say that.""
In the news conference later, Trump also appeared to have softened his attitude to Zelensky, praising him as ""very brave"" and saying the pair got on ""really well"".
Talking about the potential for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, Trump said ""progress towards peace"" would continue when Zelensky visits the White House on Friday. The two are expected to sign a major minerals deal.
At the Munich Security Conference last week, US Vice President JD Vance attacked the UK and other European democracies, warning that ""free speech is in retreat.""
Asked about the comments, Trump called on his deputy to defend himself. Vance argued ""there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British"" but also ""American technology companies and by extension, American citizens"".
That led to Sir Keir cutting in, saying ""we've had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom - and it will last for a very, very long time"".
He rejected Vance's claim, saying ""in relation to free speech in the UK, I'm very proud of our history there"".",0
Japanese woman under investigation for kissing BTS's Jin,"A Japanese woman who unexpectedly kissed K-pop boy band BTS's Jin at a fan event last year has found herself under investigation by South Korean police.
South Korean police have called for the woman - who is currently in Japan - to come forward for questioning on charges of sexual harrassment in a public space.
The incident happened during the K-pop idol's first public event in Seoul last June which saw him hug 1,000 fans. Instead of just hugging the star, the woman appeared to have kissed his face, with Jin responding by turning his face away.
The kiss angered other BTS fans, one of whom filed a criminal complaint against her, leading police to launch an investigation.
On 13 June, 2024, the day after he was discharged from the army, Jin, whose real name is Kim Seok-jin, held a fan event where he hugged 1,000 fans and performed songs in front of 3,000 others.
During the three-hour long ""hugathon"", fans who won the chance to embrace him queued up and went on stage one by one to meet the 33-year-old star.
But one of them caused an uproar when she appeared to kiss Jin's face.
Clips of the moment went viral on the internet. Videos show that Jin, taken aback by the move, tried to turn his head while hugging the woman before quickly moving on to the next fan. Fans could also be seen reacting angrily to her actions.
She later wrote on her blog later that she kissed him ""on his neck"" and ""the skin was very soft"".
The woman's identity has not been revealed but police added that they had identified her with the assistance from their Japanese counterparts.
The BBC has reached out to BTS' agency HYBE for comment.
Jin is the first BTS member to have been discharged from military duty. He was followed by J-Hope who was discharged in October. The other four - V, RM, Jimin, Jungkook and Suga - are still serving and the band is expected to reunite only in June 2025.
K-pop idols are known for having a close relationship with their fanbases through various communication channels and events. It's common for artists to communicate with fans through social media livestream chats and in-person events to cultivate loyal fans.
But fans and agencies have increasingly been aware of some toxic fan cultures as well. For example, many artists have been vocal about the stress caused by ""sasaeng fans"", who are overly obsessed with their idols that would stalk and harass the artists.",1
Volcano owners' conviction over deadly eruption thrown out,"The owners of a New Zealand volcano that erupted in 2019, killing 22 people, have had their conviction over the disaster thrown out by the country's High Court.
Whakaari Management Limited (WML) was found guilty in 2023 of failing to keep visitors safe and fined just over NZ$1m ($560,000; £445,000). They were also ordered to pay NZ$4.8m in reparation to the victims.
However, following an appeal, the High Court ruled on Friday that the company only owned the land and were not responsible for people's safety.
White Island, which is also known by its Māori name, Whakaari, is New Zealand's most active volcano and has been erupting in some form since 2011.
It had been showing signs of heightened unrest for weeks before the fatal December 2019 eruption, which killed almost half of the people who were on it at the time. Most were tourists, including 17 from Australia and three from the US.
Another 25 people were injured, with many suffering extensive burns.
High Court Justice Simon Moore said on Friday that while WML licensed tours of the volcano, there was nothing in these agreements that gave the company control of what was happening on the island day to day.
He agreed that it was reasonable for the company to rely on tour operators, as well as emergency management and science organisations, to assess risks to safety.
Justice Moore added that, in coming to his decision, he had not ignored the pain and grief of the families that had been affected.
""It is impossible not to be deeply moved and affected by the sheer scale and nature of the human loss in this case,"" he said.
Thirteen parties in total, including tour operators, were charged over the disaster. WML was the last to receive a verdict after six had pleaded guilty, while six more had their charges dismissed.
The case against WML was the largest action of its kind brought by New Zealand's regulator, Worksafe NZ, who said it acknowledged the High Court ruling and was considering whether to appeal.
James Cairney, a lawyer for James, Andrew and Peter Buttle - three brothers who own the company - said the family welcomed the decision, Radio New Zealand reported. He added that the Buttles hoped it would ""bring certainty for all landowners who grant others recreational access to their land"".
The Buttle family has owned Whakaari/White Island since the 1930s, when their grandfather bought it and placed it in a family trust. It is one of only a few privately owned islands in New Zealand.
The brothers had previously been on trial in relation to the 2019 disaster as individuals over alleged breaches of New Zealand's workplace health and safety legislation. Those charges were dismissed in 2023.",1
Trump says US will impose additional 10% tariff on China,"Donald Trump said he planned to hit goods from China with a new 10% tariff, the latest salvo in the US president's steadily escalating trade fights.
Imports from China already face taxes at the border of at least 10%, after a Trump tariff order that went into effect earlier this month.
China's ministry of foreign affairs said it ""strongly"" expressed its ""dissatisfaction and resolute opposition"" to the plans.
Trump also said on Thursday he intended to move forward with threatened 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, which are set to come into effect on 4 March.
Trump's comments came as officials from Mexico and Canada were in Washington for discussions aimed at heading off that plan.
Trump had announced the plans for 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada for 4 February unless the two nations increased border security.
He paused the measures for a month at the last minute after the two countries agreed to increase border funding and talk more about how to combat drug trafficking.
On social media on Thursday, Trump wrote that he did not think enough action had been taken to address the flow of fentanyl to the US.
""Drugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels,"" he wrote, adding that ""a large percentage"" of the drugs were made in China.
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, at a press conference from the country's National Palace, said in response: ""As we know, [Trump] has his way of communicating.""
She added: ""I hope we can reach an agreement and on 4 March we can announce something else.""
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also said his country was working hard to reach a deal, warning tariffs from the US would prompt an ""immediate and extremely strong response"".
Trump's threats against Mexico and Canada have raised widespread alarm, as the North American economy is closely connected after decades of operating under a free trade agreement.
Leaders of the two countries have previously said they would impose retaliatory tariffs on the United States if the White House went ahead with its plans.
Tariffs are a tax collected by the government and paid for by the business bringing the goods into the country.
China, Mexico and Canada are America's top three trade partners, together accounting for more than 40% of imports into the US last year.
Economists have warned tariffs on goods from the three countries could lead to higher prices in the US on everything from iPhones to avocados.
Trump's call for an additional 10% levy on goods from China - which he said would also go into effect on Tuesday - had not been previously announced, though during his presidential campaign he backed border taxes on Chinese products of as much as 60%.
A spokesperson for China's ministry of foreign affairs, Lin Jian, said that Trump was using the issue of the drug fentanyl entering the US from China as an ""excuse"" to threaten tariffs, adding it had one of the ""strictest"" drug control policies in the world.
""Pressure, coercion, and threats are not the correct way to deal with China,"" he said.
Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy, had earlier said that his country was already working with the US to address the concerns about fentanyl, and had made ""visual progress"" in areas such as information exchange, case cooperation and online advertisement cleanup.
""Reducing domestic drug demand and strengthening law enforcement cooperation are the fundamental solutions,"" he said in a statement, which warned that Trump's tariff moves were ""bound to affect and undermine future counternarcotics cooperation between the two sides"".
""The unilateral tariffs imposed by the US will not solve its own problems, nor will it benefit the two sides or the world.""

Trump's comments, which called for drug flow to stop or be ""severely limited"", seemed to set the stage for Mexico and Canada to negotiate, said trade expert Christine McDaniel, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Washington University.
On Thursday, as tariff talks intensified, two imprisoned alleged leaders of the violent Zetas cartel long sought by the US - Miguel Angel Trevino Morales and his brother Oscar - were extradited.
Mexican media said they were part of a larger group of drug lords sent from Mexico to the US - a major step in terms of US-Mexico security relations.
Ms McDaniel said Trump's demands of China were less clear, raising the likelihood that those measures will come into effect.
Trump's initial round of tariffs on China was eclipsed by his threats against Canada and Mexico. But the potential for further duties raises questions about how businesses will respond.
Ms McDaniel said she expected the hit to be felt more in China.
""It's not costless for the US, but so far it seems more costly for China,"" she said.
The impact of tariffs, if they go into effect, is expected to be felt more in the Canadian and Mexican economies, which count on the US as a key export market.
But analysts have warned that the threat of the levies, even if they are never imposed, is still likely to have a chilling effect on investment, including in the US.
China has already responded to the first round of tariffs from the US with its own tariffs on US products, including coal and agricultural machinery.
Trump has dismissed fears about damage to the American economy.",0
Key takeaways from Starmer's talks with Trump,"UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has met US President Donald Trump during his first visit to the White House.

Trump commends Zelensky ahead of White House talks,"US President Donald Trump has said he has a ""lot of respect"" for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, on the eve of their talks at the White House.
Asked by the BBC if he would apologise for recently calling him a ""dictator"", he said he could not believe he had said this. He also called Zelensky ""very brave"".
Trump was speaking after talks with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer about ending the war between Ukraine and Russia.
He predicted a ""very good meeting"" with Zelensky on Friday, saying efforts to achieve peace were ""moving along pretty rapidly"".
This week's meetings come after the Trump administration shocked its Western partners by holding the first high-level US talks with Moscow since Russia invaded Ukraine just over three years ago.
America's new president had appeared to blame Zelensky for the war and chided him for not starting peace talks earlier.
""You've been there for three years,"" he had said last Tuesday. ""You should have ended it... You should have never started it. You could have made a deal.""
But this Thursday, speaking after meeting Sir Keir, Trump told reporters asking about his forthcoming talks with Zelensky: ""I think we're going to have a very good meeting tomorrow morning. We're going to get along really well.""
Asked by the BBC's Chris Mason if he still thought Zelensky was a ""dictator"", he replied: ""Did I say that? I can't believe I said that.""
Zelensky will be hoping to win some kind of security guarantees for his country that would underpin any peace deal that may be negotiated.
Asked about these on Thursday, Trump only said he was ""open to many things"" but he wanted to get Russia and Ukraine to agree a deal before deciding what measures might be put in place to enforce it.
On his visit on Friday, Zelensky is expected to sign a deal that will give the US access to Ukraine's rare earth mineral resources.
Trump suggested that the presence of US mining concerns in Ukraine would act as a deterrent against future Russian attacks on Ukraine.
""It's a backstop, you could say,"" he said on Thursday. ""I don't think anybody's going to play around if we're there with a lot of workers and having to do with rare earths and other things which we need for our country.""
The British prime minister had said earlier that the UK was prepared to send troops to Ukraine after the war as part of a peacekeeping force but only if the US, Nato's leading member, provided a ""backstop"".
Asked if the US would aid British peacekeepers if they were attacked by Russia, Trump said: ""The British have incredible soldiers, incredible military and they can take care of themselves. But if they need help, I'll always be with the British, okay?""
Nato's Article 5 holds that Nato members will come to the defence of an ally which comes under attack.
Praising Trump's ""personal commitment to bring peace"" in Ukraine, Sir Keir said the UK was ""ready to put boots on the ground and planes in the air to support a deal"".
""We're focused now on bringing an enduring end to the barbaric war in Ukraine,"" he said.
But, he added, it must not be a peace deal ""that rewards the aggressor or that gives encouragement to regimes like Iran"".
Asked whether Vladimir Putin was trustworthy, the UK prime minister said his views on the Russian president were well-known.
Asked in turn why he seemed to trust Putin and Sir Keir did not, Trump said: ""I know a lot of people that you would say no chance that they would ever deceive you, and they are the worst people in the world.
""I know others that you would guarantee they would deceive you, and you know what, they're 100% honourable, so you never know what you're getting.""
EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, who had been due to meet US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington before he cancelled the talks ""due to scheduling issues"", told BBC News that Putin and Russia did ""not want to have peace"".
""For any peace agreement to function, it needs the Europeans as well as Ukrainians on board,"" she added.
Stopping off in the Irish Republic on Thursday en route to the US, Zelensky met the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Micheál Martin at Shannon Airport.
""We discussed the steps to end the war with guaranteed peace for Ukraine and the whole of Europe,"" he said later.
Following the overthrow of Ukraine's pro-Russian president in 2014, Moscow annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and backed pro-Russian separatists in bloody fighting in eastern Ukraine.
The conflict burst into all-out war when Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022.
It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people, most of them soldiers, have been killed or injured, and millions of Ukrainian civilians have fled as refugees.
As well as Crimea, Russia now occupies parts of four other regions - Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.
The Kremlin warned on Thursday that Russia would make no territorial concessions to Ukraine as part of a peace deal.
""All territories that have become subjects of the Russian Federation... are an integral part of our country, Russia,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. ""This is an absolutely indisputable fact and a non-negotiable fact.""
Separately, Russian and US officials met in the Turkish city of Istanbul for talks on rebuilding diplomatic ties.

Japan's MeToo icon is up for an Oscar - but the film can't air in the country,"When Japanese journalist Shiori Ito decided to speak up about her rape allegations, she knew she was standing in the face of a society that preferred silence.
""I'm scared…but all I want to do is to talk about the truth"", Shiori says in the opening scene of her Oscar-nominated documentary Black Box Diaries.
Shiori became the face of Japan's MeToo movement after she accused a prominent journalist Noriyuki Yamaguchi of rape.
Her acclaimed directorial debut, based on her memoir of the same name, is a retelling of her quest for justice after authorities found the evidence insufficient to pursue criminal charges.
But there is one country where it is yet to play: Japan, where it has run into huge controversy. Her former lawyers have accused her of including audio and video footage she did not have permission to use, which, they say, has violated trust and put her sources at risk. Shiori defends what she did as necessary for ""public good"".
It's a startling turn in a story that gripped Japan when it first broke -the then 28-year-old Shiori ignored her family's request to remain silent. And after her public accusation did not result in a criminal case, she filed a civil lawsuit against Yamaguchi and won $30,000 (£22,917) in damages.
Shiori told the BBC making the film involved ""reliving her trauma"": ""It took me four years [to make the film] because emotionally I was struggling.""
She was an intern at Reuters news agency in 2015, when she says Yamaguchi invited her to discuss a job opportunity. He was the Washington bureau chief for a major Japanese media firm, Tokyo Broadcasting System.
Shiori claims she was raped following a dinner in Tokyo with Yamaguchi, who has always denied the allegations.
CCTV footage of an intoxicated Shiori being dragged from a taxi and into a hotel is part of the more than 400 hours of footage she edited for the documentary.
The editing process, she says, was ""really challenging. It was like hardcore exposure therapy.""
When the film was released, the CCTV footage became a source of friction as Shiori's team of ex-lawyers, who helped her win her lawsuit, slammed the documentary.
They claimed it was unauthorised use of CCTV footage - and that she had violated a pledge not to use it outside of court proceedings. .
Last week, her former lawyers – led by Yoko Nishihiro - held another press conference, saying her use of the footage posed challenges for other sexual assault cases.
""If the fact that the evidence from the trial has been made public is known, we will be unable to obtain cooperation in future cases,"" Ms Nishihiro said.
Ms Nishihiro claimed that Shiori had also used unauthorised recordings, saying she only found this out at a screening of the film last July.
This included audio of a police detective who eventually acted as a whistleblower about the investigation process – as well as a video of a taxi driver who provided testimony about the night of the alleged rape. Both of them, the lawyers argued, were identifiable and neither had given their consent to be featured in the film.
""I've been trying so hard to protect her for eight-and-half years, and I feel like I've been completely torn apart,"" Ms Nishihiro said.
""I want her to explain and be held accountable.""
Shiori had earlier acknowledged that she did not have the hotel's permission to use the CCTV but argued that this was ""the only visual evidence"" she had of the night she was sexually assaulted.
She added that including audio of the police detective was necessary because of ""the cover up of the investigation"", adding that she was releasing the video ""for the public good"".
""We are standing in different points of view,"" she said of the fallout with her former lawyers.
""For me, [it's for the] public good. For them, it's 'do not break any rules'.""
There has been no official explanation as to why the film has not yet been distributed. Shiori has said that ""Japan is still not ready to talk about [it]"", but its unclear how much of it is also due to legal hurdles.
In her latest statement last week, Shiori apologised and said she would re-edit parts of the documentary to make sure individuals would not be identified, adding that a redacted version would be screened moving forward.
""There are moments I wish I didn't have to put in [the documentary]. There are moments I'm not proud of but I wanted to put all of it and to show we are also human,"" she told the BBC. ""No-one is perfect.""
In the nine years since the assault, Shiori's fight against Japan's justice system has been well-chronicled in the media - and is something she says she wanted to detail in her documentary.
She was met with a wave of backlash when she went public in 2017, receiving hate mail and online abuse.
""People were telling me you're not crying enough… you're not wearing proper clothes... you're too strong.""
Some criticised the way she was dressed at the press conference where she first accused Yamaguchi – they said her shirt had been buttoned too low down. Shiori said she left Japan for a few months, fearing for her safety.
Shiori's case was followed by other high-profile cases. In 2023, former soldier Rina Gonoi also went public with her story, accusing three ex-soldiers of sexually assaulting her. This was the year Japan passed landmark laws to redefine rape from ""forcible sexual intercourse"" to ""non-consensual sexual intercourse"" and raised the age of consent from 13 to 16.
Gonoi eventually won her case but Shiori says it is proof that speaking up against sexual violence comes at a price, adding: ""Is it worth going through this as a survivor seeking justice? It shouldn't be this way. You have to sacrifice a lot.""
For now it's unclear if her film will ever be screened in Japan, but she says that its homecoming would be her ultimate prize.
""This is my love letter to Japan. I really wish one day I can screen my film, and my family can also watch it,"" she added.
""That's what I really hope for… more than winning an Oscar.""",0
Cook Islands China deal riles allies as West's grip loosens,"The Cook Islands may be small but the ambitions of its leader are mighty.
A range of deals Prime Minister Mark Brown signed with China without consulting the public or New Zealand – an ally to which the Cooks is closely tied – has caused increasing irritation and concern.
The agreements are the first of their kind with a country that is not a traditional ally. They cover infrastructure, ship-building, tourism, agriculture, technology, education and, perhaps crucially, deep-sea mineral exploration.
Brown says his decisions will be based on the ""long-term interests"" of the Cook Islands, which are remote, resource-rich and vulnerable to climate change.
Not everyone agrees with him. The new, wide-ranging deals with Beijing have led to protests on Rarotonga - the largest Cook Island - and a vote of no confidence against Brown in parliament, which he survived earlier this week. They have also worried Australia, another powerful ally.
New Zealand said it was ""blindsided"" by the China deals, but Brown believes his country is independent and does not need to consult Wellington on issues he says are of no concern to them.
He has, nevertheless, tried to reassure Australia and New Zealand that the deals with China don't replace their relationships. But the apparent snub comes at a time when the West's grip on the Pacific seems to be loosening.
The rise of China in the Pacific isn't new. Whether it's bagging a security deal in the Solomon Islands or providing medical services in Tonga, China's presence in the region has been growing. And the US and its allies have made a consistent effort to counter that.
But now there is a new dynamic at play as the Trump administration upends relationships with allies such as Ukraine and appears increasingly unpredictable.
The Cook Islands has had what's known as a ""free association"" relationship with New Zealand, a former coloniser, since the 1960s - meaning Wellington helps on issues like defence and foreign affairs, and that Cook Islanders hold New Zealand citizenship.
The two countries are very close. There are around 15,000 Cook Islanders living in the Pacific island nation, but as many as 100,000 live in New Zealand and Australia. Culturally, Cook Island Māori - who make up the majority of the population - are also closely related to, but distinct from, New Zealand Māori.
The deals with China aren't the only sign that Brown wants to pull away from New Zealand which have caused concern. He recently abandoned a proposal to introduce a Cook Islands passport following a public outcry.
""[The relationship with NZ] connects us politically and connects us to our brothers and sisters of Aotearoa [the Māori word for New Zealand] – they left our shores to sail to Aotearoa. We need to remember that,"" said Cook Islander Jackie Tuara at a recent demonstration against Brown's deals with China.
In a nation that is not used to huge displays of protest, several hundred people gathered outside parliament in Rarotonga, holding up placards that read: ""Stay connected with NZ"". Others waved their New Zealand passports.
""Let us stand in partnership with countries that have the same democratic principles as we are a democratic nation, are we not?"" Ms Tuara said. ""We don't want to see our land and our oceans sold to the highest bidder. Those resources are for us – for our children, for their future.""
But for all those who are opposed to Brown's recent moves away from New Zealand, there are plenty of Cook Islanders who back him.
China specialist Philipp Ivanov, in apparent agreement with the prime minister, says that ""the Pacific island nations have their own agency, their own motivations and their own capabilities"".
He believes that the recent developments in the Cook Islands are ""all part of that little great game that's going on between Australia and China and New Zealand in the Pacific. It's a whack-a-mole kind of game.""
While the US has long been a dominant force in security and military in the region, China has tried to strengthen its ties with the small but strategic Pacific Island nations through aid, infrastructure and security deals.
In response, the likes of the US and the UK have beefed up their diplomatic presence across the region. Australia too has made it clear it will redouble its support. But it's unclear to what extent US President Donald Trump will continue his predecessor's commitments in the region to counter China - and Beijing is taking advantage of that.
Last week, planes flying between New Zealand and Australia were diverted after China conducted military exercises involving live fire. Both Australia and New Zealand had been trailing the three Chinese warships that were making their way down the eastern coast of Australia in what experts say is an escalation and unexpected show of power.
""It's a pretty efficient way of testing the diplomatic response in both the Australia-China and New Zealand-China bilateral relationship, and what the US is prepared to say in defence [of its allies],"" says defence analyst Euan Graham, from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.
""It's also making the point that in the numbers game, China will always be ahead of smaller countries with smaller navies and Australia's navy is at a historic low.""
China's ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, told national broadcaster ABC that Beijing's actions had been appropriate and he won't apologise for it.
Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has been keen to emphasise that no international laws were broken and that the drills were carried out in international waters. Indeed, many have pointed out that Australia and its allies often sail warships through the South China Sea.
""I'd see it as China wanting to capitalise on the chaotic effect that Trump is having right now,"" says Mihai Sora, director of the Pacific Islands programme at Australia's Lowy Institute. ""China is taking advantage of that moment to [say], look Australia, you are actually alone. Where is the United States in all of this?""
Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong freely admits ""we are in a permanent state of contest in our region, that is the reality"".
In speaking out about the warships last week, Australia's government was trying to reassure the public about China's intentions, while also wanting to tell Australians that it's all in hand. That is not a coincidence as Australia heads towards a federal election in the coming months.
""[Opposition leader Peter] Dutton comes from this national security and home affairs background, so the government doesn't want to give him any air to criticise Labor,"" Philipp Ivanov says. ""Being weak on China would be disastrous for them, given what's going on in the US and given our own elections.""
But it also brings into focus the dilemma this part of the world faces.
""Canberra will be contesting every single move that Beijing tries to make … and it reflects the fact that Canberra and Beijing have diverging strategic interests,"" says James Laurenceson, the director of Australia-China Relations Institute at the University of Technology Sydney.
But, he adds, they also have ""enormous commonalities"" - China is Australia's largest trading partner - and New Zealand's - for instance.
""So you've got to be able to ride both these horses at the same time.""
It's not an easy relationship - it never has been. The bigger surprise is that of the US, a traditional ally.
Although many in the Trump administration still describe China as a grave threat, US allies are unsure what to expect from the Washington-Beijing relationship.
And now, as Trump threatens steel and aluminium tariffs and a withdrawal of foreign assistance, Australia feels more isolated than ever. The recent activity of China's warships in the Tasman Sea serves to highlight that isolation.
""I wouldn't think of them as military acts, so much as political acts using military hardware,"" says Mr Sora of the Lowy Institute.
""I think the political act is to say, look, we can do this anytime we want. You can't do anything about it, and the United States is not doing anything about it, because they're busy tearing down the global system.""",0
Japanese woman under investigation for kissing BTS's Jin,"A Japanese woman who unexpectedly kissed K-pop boy band BTS's Jin at a fan event last year has found herself under investigation by South Korean police.
South Korean police have called for the woman - who is currently in Japan - to come forward for questioning on charges of sexual harrassment in a public space.
The incident happened during the K-pop idol's first public event in Seoul last June which saw him hug 1,000 fans. Instead of just hugging the star, the woman appeared to have kissed his face, with Jin responding by turning his face away.
The kiss angered other BTS fans, one of whom filed a criminal complaint against her, leading police to launch an investigation.
On 13 June, 2024, the day after he was discharged from the army, Jin, whose real name is Kim Seok-jin, held a fan event where he hugged 1,000 fans and performed songs in front of 3,000 others.
During the three-hour long ""hugathon"", fans who won the chance to embrace him queued up and went on stage one by one to meet the 33-year-old star.
But one of them caused an uproar when she appeared to kiss Jin's face.
Clips of the moment went viral on the internet. Videos show that Jin, taken aback by the move, tried to turn his head while hugging the woman before quickly moving on to the next fan. Fans could also be seen reacting angrily to her actions.
She later wrote on her blog later that she kissed him ""on his neck"" and ""the skin was very soft"".
The woman's identity has not been revealed but police added that they had identified her with the assistance from their Japanese counterparts.
The BBC has reached out to BTS' agency HYBE for comment.
Jin is the first BTS member to have been discharged from military duty. He was followed by J-Hope who was discharged in October. The other four - V, RM, Jimin, Jungkook and Suga - are still serving and the band is expected to reunite only in June 2025.
K-pop idols are known for having a close relationship with their fanbases through various communication channels and events. It's common for artists to communicate with fans through social media livestream chats and in-person events to cultivate loyal fans.
But fans and agencies have increasingly been aware of some toxic fan cultures as well. For example, many artists have been vocal about the stress caused by ""sasaeng fans"", who are overly obsessed with their idols that would stalk and harass the artists.",0
"Five years since deadly Delhi riots, many police cases are falling apart","Five years after deadly religious riots engulfed India's capital Delhi, there is no legal closure in sight for the people involved.
A BBC Hindi analysis has found that more than 80% of the cases related to the violence where courts gave decisions have resulted in acquittals or discharges.
More than 50 people, mostly Muslims, were killed after clashes broke out between Hindus and Muslims over a controversial citizenship law in February 2020. The violence - the deadliest the city had seen in decades - stretched on for days, with hundreds of homes and shops set on fire by violent mobs.
The BBC had earlier reported on incidents of police brutality and complicity during the riots. The police have denied any wrongdoing and in their investigation, alleged that the violence was ""pre-planned"" as a part of a larger conspiracy to ""threaten India's unity"" by the people who were protesting against the law.
They registered 758 cases in connection with the investigation and arrested more than 2,000 people. This included 18 student leaders and activists who were arrested in a case that came to be known as the ""main conspiracy case"". They were charged under a draconian anti-terror law that makes it nearly impossible to get bail. Only six of them have been released in five years, and some like activist Umar Khalid are still in jail, waiting for a trial to begin.
BBC Hindi examined the status of all the 758 cases filed in relation to the riots and analysed the 126 cases in which the Karkardooma court in Delhi had given decisions.
More than 80% of these 126 cases resulted in acquittals or discharges as witnesses turned hostile, or did not support the prosecution's case. Only 20 of these cases saw convictions.
Under Indian law, an accused is discharged when a court closes a case without a trial because there isn't sufficient evidence to go ahead. An acquittal is when the court finds the accused not guilty after a full trial.
In 62 of the 758 cases that were filed on charges related to murder, there was only one conviction and four acquittals, data accessed by the BBC through India's Right to Information law shows.
A detailed analysis of the 126 orders also showed that in dozens of cases, the court came down heavily on the Delhi police for lapses in investigations. In some cases, it criticised the police for filing ""predetermined chargesheets"" that ""falsely implicated"" the accused.
In most of the 126 cases, police officials were presented as witnesses to the events. But for various reasons, the court did not find their testimonies credible.
Judges have pointed out inconsistencies in the police statements, delays in identification of the accused by the police and, in some instances, cast doubts over whether policemen were even present when the violence broke out.
In two orders, the judge said that he could not ""restrain"" himself from saying that when history looked back at the riots, the ""failure of the investigating agency to conduct a proper investigation"" would ""torment the sentinels of democracy"". The court was hearing cases filed against three men on charges of arson and looting - but concluded they had been arrested without any ""real or effective investigation"".
The Delhi police did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. In a report filed last April, the police had told the court that all investigations were carried out in a ""credible, fair and impartial"" way.
Testimonies from some of the accused and even the court's own observations, however, raise questions about the investigation.
Shadab Alam, who spent 80 days in jail, says he can never forget the terror of the riots.
He had taken shelter on the rooftop terrace of a medicine store where he worked with a few others.
Just hours earlier, the police had arrived at the shop and asked them to shut it because of ongoing arson.
""Suddenly, they [the police] came again and took a few of us into their van,"" he told the BBC.
When he asked the police why he was being taken, he said, they accused him of participating in rioting.
""They asked us our names and beat us up. Almost all of us arrested were Muslims,"" Mr Alam said. He added that he submitted his medical report before the court that confirmed three injuries.
In its official report, the police charged Mr Alam and 10 other Muslims of burning down a shop. But the court discharged all of them even before the trial could begin.
In its observations, the court criticised the police investigation saying that the witness's statements could have been ""artificially prepared"", and that ""in all probabilities"" the shop was burnt by a ""mob of persons from the Hindu community"".
It said the police did not pursue the case in that direction, despite being present when the incident happened.
Mr Alam had to wait four years for the case to be officially closed.
""All this happened during Covid-19 pandemic. There was a lockdown. We were in a state of frenzy,"" said Dilshad Ali, Alam's father.
""In the end, nothing was proved. But we had to spend so much time and money to prove our innocence.""
He said the family wanted monetary compensation for their losses. ""If the police made a false case against my son, then action should be taken against them,"" he added.
In another case, the court acquitted Sandip Bhati, who was accused of dragging and beating a Muslim man during the riots.
The police had submitted two videos to show Mr Bhati was the culprit. But in court, his lawyer said that the police had submitted an incomplete clip to frame his client.
In the full video, which the BBC has verified, Mr Bhati is seen saving the Muslim man instead of beating him up.
In its order in January, the court ruled that the police ""manipulated"" the video to ""frame"" Mr Bhati instead of tracing the ""actual culprits"".
It also asked the commissioner of Delhi police to take appropriate action against the investigating officer in the case. The police did not respond to BBC Hindi's question on whether this had been done.
Mr Bhati, who spent four months in prison, refused to comment, saying he did not wish to discuss his ""ordeal"".
With so many acquittals, former Supreme Court judge Madan Lokur said, the prosecution and police ""should sit down to introspect what they have achieved in five years"".
He also said that ""accountability needs to be fixed on the prosecution as well if the arrest is found to be illegal or unnecessary"".
""If the prosecution puts someone in jail because they have the power to do so or because they want to do so, they should not be allowed to get away with it if the incarceration is found to be illegal or unnecessary,"" he added.
Even as some cases fall apart in courts, many of those arrested are still languishing in jail awaiting a trial.
Gulfisha Fatima, a 33-year-old PhD aspirant, is among 12 activists who are still in jail on charges of being ""conspirators"" of the riots.
Her family said three other police cases were lodged against her and she got bail in all of them. But she continues to face incarceration in a fourth case under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) - the stringent anti-terror law that sets exceptionally challenging conditions for bail.
""Since she's gone to jail, with every hearing we hope she will finally come out,"" her father Syed Tasneef Hussain told the BBC.
In Ms Fatima's case, after months of hearing the bail plea, the judge from the Delhi High Court got transferred in 2023, and now the entire case is being heard again.
""Sometimes I wonder if I'll be able to see her or if I'll die before that,"" Mr Hussain said.

Qatar Airways says crew handled dead passenger 'appropriately',"Qatar Airways says an internal review has found that its crew ""acted quickly, appropriately and professionally"" when they placed the body of a woman who died mid-flight next to an Australian couple.
The airline issued the statement to the BBC on Friday, after the couple told Australia's Channel Nine that they were traumatised by the experience on the Melbourne to Doha flight.
Qatar Airways had apologised in a previous statement for ""any inconvenience or distress this incident may have caused"".
The incident sparked debate over procedures on dealing with deaths aboard planes.
Mitchell Ring and Jennifer Colin, who were travelling to Venice for a holiday, said the cabin crew had placed the dead woman, covered in blankets, next to Mr Ring for the last four hours of a 14-hour flight.
The cabin crew had trouble moving her body through the aisle to the business class section because ""she was quite a large lady"", Mr Ring said.
They then asked Mr Ring to move over and placed the lady in the seat he was in.
While Ms Colin was invited by another passenger to sit beside her across the aisle, Mr Ring said the plane's staff did not offer to move him elsewhere even though there were vacant seats around.
Qatar Airways said on Friday that the crew's handling of the woman's death was ""in line with training and industry standard practice"".
""Passengers were accommodated to other seats, and a crew member was sitting at all times with the deceased passenger for the duration of the flight until landing in Doha,"" its statement said.
""It is an unfortunate reality that unexpected deaths do sometimes occur on board aircraft across the aviation industry and our crew are highly trained to deal with these situations with as much respect and dignity as possible.""
The airline also said that they have offered support and compensation to the family of the deceased and other passengers who were ""directly affected"" by the incident.
""We totally understand that we can't hold the airline responsible for the poor lady's death, but surely after that there has to be a protocol to look after the customers on board,"" Ms Colin said in the televised interview with Channel 9.
When the plane landed, Mr Ring said passengers were asked to stay put while medical staff and police came on board. Ambulance officers then started pulling blankets off the woman and he saw her face, he said.
""I can't believe they told us to stay,"" he said, adding that he thought they would have let the passengers leave before medical staff arrived.
Barry Eustance, a former Virgin Atlantic captain, earlier told the BBC that in his experience ""the crew would normally try to isolate the body, so there is no passenger exposure to the body and vice versa, for respect and privacy but also for medical reasons"".
According to the guidelines by the International Air Transport Association on dealing with deaths on board a flight, the deceased person should be moved to a seat, preferably one with few other passengers nearby, and covered with a blanket or body bag up to the neck. The body could also be moved to another area that does not obstruct an aisle or exit.
Upon landing, the association recommends that other passengers disembark before the body is attended to by local authorities.

Notorious Mexican drug lord among 29 extradited to US,"Mexico has extradited 29 alleged drug cartel members to the United States – including high-profile gang leaders.
Those extradited include notorious drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero who has been wanted by the US for the murder of an American agent 40 years ago.
The move – considered to be of the biggest extraditions in Mexico's history – is seen as a major step in bilateral security relations between the two countries.
It comes after US President Donald Trump threatened earlier this year to impose tariffs on imports from Mexico, accusing it of failing to tackle drug trafficking and mass migration.
""As President Trump has made clear, cartels are terrorist groups, and this Department of Justice is devoted to destroying cartels and transnational gangs,"" US Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement on Thursday night.
""We will prosecute these criminals to the fullest extent of the law in honour of the brave law enforcement agents who have dedicated their careers – and in some cases, given their lives – to protect innocent people from the scourge of violent cartels,"" she added.
Caro Quintero is one of the founding members of the Guadalajara Cartel and a linchpin in the creation of modern Mexican drug-trafficking.
He was wanted in the US in connection with the torture and murder of a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent, Enrique 'Kiki' Camarena in 1985.
Caro Quintero was arrested at the time and spent 28 years in prison in Mexico before being released in 2013 – much to the anger of the Americans.
But in 2022, aged in his 70s he was recaptured by the Mexican Navy after a dog found him hiding in bushes.
Reacting to Caro Quintero's extradition DEA Acting Administrator Derek Maltz hailed the move as a ""victory for the Camarena family"".
He added: ""Today sends a message to every cartel leader, every trafficker, every criminal poisoning our communities: You will be held accountable.
""No matter how long it takes, no matter how far you run, justice will find you.""
Quintero is expected to appear in court in New York on Friday.
Other fugitives extradited include the founders of the brutal Zetas Cartel - Miguel Angel Treviño and his brother Omar Treviño.
Known as Z-40 and Z-42 respectively, the two men ran the feared organisation for years before its eventual demise in the mid 2010s.
Miguel Treviño, who was arrested by Mexican marines in July 2013, was wanted on both sides of the border for ordering massacres and running drugs on a global scale.
Omar Treviño - who was wanted in the US and Mexico on charges of drug trafficking, kidnap and murder - was captured by security forces in Monterrey in March 2015.
Their criminal empire spanned a wide range of illicit activities including cocaine-smuggling, people trafficking, extortion, gun-running and kidnappings.
Police in Webb County, Texas, confirmed the brothers extradition and warned Americans from crossing into Mexico for fear of reprisals.",0
"Israel's military failed to protect civilians, first report on 7 October attack says","Israel's military has published its first official account of the mistakes that led to its failures during Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack, which triggered the Gaza war.
The report concludes that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ""failed in its mission to protect Israeli civilians"".
The 19-page report contains much that is already known about what led to catastrophic loss of about 1,200 lives when approximately 5,000 gunmen from Hamas and other Palestinian groups stormed into Israel, also taking 251 hostages in the process.
There are no dramatic revelations, but it is still sobering to see the military's conclusions about how it misjudged Hamas's intentions and underestimated its capabilities laid out in black and white.
The report says the military regarded Gaza as a secondary security threat, with priority given to Iran and Hezbollah. Its policy towards Gaza, it says, was ""paradoxical: Hamas was illegitimate, yet there was no effort to develop an alternative"".
The military had chosen a ""conflict management"" approach to dealing with Gaza, it says. And had assumed that Hamas was ""neither interested [in] nor preparing for a large-scale war"" - a perception reinforced by Hamas's own deception tactics.
Evidence from 2018 onwards suggesting that Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist group by Israel, the US, UK and other countries - was indeed developing an ambitious plan was interpreted as ""unrealistic or unfeasible"", reflecting ""Hamas's long-term aspirations rather than an actionable threat"".
The report says that in the months leading up to the war, the Military Intelligence Directorate began to develop a new assessment, suggesting that Hamas's plan was not merely a vision but ""a concrete framework for operational planning"".
However, this emerging assessment was not brought to the attention of senior officials in military intelligence.
The report identifies a broad streak of complacency within the military about Hamas's intentions and how to deal with the threat it posed.
""There was no deep discussion of the question: What if we are wrong?"" the report says.
Over time, ""a significant and continuous gap between the intelligence assessments of Hamas and reality"" had developed.
The report also highlights what it says was ""a decline in deep familiarity with the enemy's different worldview, including its culture, religion, language and history"".
It calls for deep reform of the intelligence directorate's culture, ""fostering intellectual openness, scepticism, listening, learning, debate, and constructive disagreement"".
It says the desire to protect highly valuable intelligence sources contributed to the military's failure to raise the alert level immediately before 7 October.
The Gaza Division, it says, ""was effectively defeated for several hours"" on 7 October, significantly impairing its ability to understand what was going on and respond effectively.
It says the Air Force responded quickly, but that ""there was significant difficulty distinguishing between IDF troops, civilians and terrorists"".
The report also says that in some incidents, wounded soldiers were evacuated before civilians.
After presenting the findings to commanders on Monday, the IDF's outgoing chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, said he took full responsibility for the failures.
""I embrace my responsibility. It is mine. I was the commander of the army on 7 October and I have my responsibility and I have all of your responsibility. I see that as mine too. And I see that in every command of mine that went wrong, there is also a part of me,"" he said in a video.
Last month, the general announced his resignation over the failures and called for a commission of inquiry to carry out a broader investigation that would help prevent another attack.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has not acknowledged any responsibility for what happened on 7 October, has said such a state inquiry should wait until the end of the war.
His critics accuse Mr Netanyahu of being unwilling to admit any personal fault.
Israel responded to the 7 October attack by launching an air and ground campaign in Gaza, during which at least 48,365 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry.",0
BBC visits US supermax prison the government hopes will solve UK crisis,"A pungent smell of detergent and rotten food hits me as we walk through this enormous high-security prison. Inmates press themselves up against the bars to look at us. There are no smiles, only expressionless stares.
A man with a tattoo that swirls across his face shouts, ""Where you from, ma'am?""
""England.""
""Hope you enjoy Estelle,"" he says.
""Do you?"" I ask.
""A lot better than where I was before.""
Welcome to the Estelle Supermax Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas.
Concrete watchtowers punctuate the perimeter of this vast space - equivalent in size to almost 3,000 football pitches - and a sign with an image of a red-maned lion and the words Stay Hungry - Feast on Success greets staff and visitors as they enter.
The UK government is looking to Estelle prison for ideas - for ways to reduce reoffending and to bring down prisoner numbers in our already overcrowded jails. There's a scheme here they'd like to emulate, which gives inmates the chance to shorten their sentences by having a job while they're inside.
Looking to this prison for inspiration might seem a curious choice to many, given Texas executes more people than any other US state. But ministers say by implementing schemes similar to ones used here, UK prisoners will be incentivised to gain qualifications - giving them more chance of employment once released.
Just one in five offenders in England and Wales has a job six weeks after being released from custody, the latest stats show. According to the Ministry of Justice, people who are still unemployed six weeks after being released are twice as likely to reoffend as those in employment.
No prison in the UK has as many inmates as they do at Estelle. More than 3,000 men in white jail-suits are currently locked up here - from murderers and rapists, to those doing time for lesser crimes like shoplifting and fraud. Two inmates are on death row.
Jimmy Delgado is 52 and serving three life sentences for first-degree murder. He's already been inside for 25 years - 13 spent in solitary confinement. He's a large man with muscular shoulders and smiles broadly when we meet in the prison chapel, softly shaking my hand. He tells me he first ended up in prison aged just 16, after carrying out a robbery.
He's remorseful for his crimes and says this prison - together with his faith in Jesus - has helped turn his life around by giving him purpose. He now works as a counsellor, supporting offenders who are struggling to cope with life in prison.
""I'm here for taking a life - and I'm here to save multiple lives,"" he says. ""If I can change the dynamic of family life for all these guys that are here then I've done my job - even if I never get out of prison.""
Delgado may never be released, but inmates having jobs in prison is one of the reasons why Estelle Supermax Penitentiary is appealing to the UK government.
The ""good time credit"" scheme used here gives inmates the opportunity to reduce their time behind bars by participating in courses and studying for qualifications, taking up jobs, and behaving well.
Credits earned are then added to the number of days the prisoner has already spent in jail, allowing them to reach their parole eligibility date sooner - when a panel decides if they're suitable for early release. This process depends on the classification of their crime and an assessment by the parole board on their overall rehabilitation.
Off the long corridor that runs through the main prison building, inmates are quietly working in a small barbers. Kevin Smith is inside for minor offences. He is meticulously cutting a member of staff's hair with a pair of clippers, and says the good time credit scheme has made him feel positive about his time in prison.
""They helped me see that if I do the right thing and make the right decisions, I can do better in life,"" he says. ""I receive good time by working here, and I can get out earlier with the good time that I received - it works.""
The rates of those returning to prison within three years of release have fallen to 20.3% in Texas - a fraction of those in the rest of the United States (68%).
The BBC came to Estelle to see their credit scheme in action with UK justice secretary Shabana Mahmood.
""The Texans had a system similar to ours - on the point of collapse, running out of prison places in 2007,"" Ms Mahmood says. ""They've now got a sustainable prison population - but most importantly, they've been able to massively cut the rates of reoffending here. They've got a rate of crime now that they haven't seen since the 1960s.""
She believes the Texan credit system is effective - helping prisoners get out of prison early - and stay out. ""It does help prisoners turn their backs on a life of crime.""
The Texas prison population is the highest of any state in the US, with 134,668 people in custody in the autumn of 2024 - although over the last couple of decades, since reforms were implemented, that number has reduced by nearly 20%. However, some experts say the good time credit programme is not a magic bullet.
""The incentivisation scheme has little to do with the reforms that helped bring Texas's prison population down in 2007,"" says Michele Deitch, a criminal justice policy lecturer at the University of Texas. ""And by itself it will do little to address the UK's very serious overcrowding problem.""
What would make a real difference, she says, would be diverting more people from incarceration in the first place: ""To shorten sentences, to reduce the use of recalls to prison, and to invest more heavily in rehabilitative programs in prison and in programs and services in the community.""
As well as incentivisation, the UK government is also considering the use of ""diversion programmes"" - where offenders are sent on rehabilitation courses rather than to jail. This can apply to people with addiction issues or mental health problems. It's what they do here in Texas to reduce the burden on the courts and attempt to sort the root cause of the offence.
More people have been put to death in Texas than anywhere else in the US. Since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976, 593 prisoners have been executed. There are 176 people currently on death row - so it might seem strange the UK government could take a leaf out of their book.
Even so, the justice secretary believes there is still much the UK can learn from what happens at Estelle.
""I don't think that the fact that they have the death penalty here means that we shouldn't be learning lessons from strategies that they've introduced that really work,"" Ms Mahmood says.
It's a plan with ""huge potential in the UK"" according to Nick Hardwick, a former chief inspector of prisons, who believes it will make prisons safer and more productive.
""It will help ensure prisoners are doing what is necessary to reduce the risk they will reoffend and create more victims,"" he says.
But not everyone agrees with incentivising convicted criminals to work towards an early release from prison.
Samantha Nicholls' son was murdered in 2018. Twenty-two year old Joe Pooley was thrown into a river in Ipswich and held under the water. Three people were jailed for his murder in 2021. Joe's mother believes inmates should never be released before their sentence is complete.
""Prison is a punishment - you should do your time,"" she says. ""It needs to be a deterrent - you're there because you did something wrong.""
It's clear the UK needs to find solutions to cut prison overcrowding – and find them fast. Even the recent prisoner early release scheme will barely keep pace with more offenders being jailed. New prison buildings will take years to come on stream. But does this Texan prison have the answers?
The challenge for ministers and the criminal justice system is how to stop the revolving doors on the UK's prisons - the reoffending and lack of prospects facing those who are released which draws them back into crime.",0

"'I need help': Freed from Myanmar's scam centres, thousands are now stranded","""I swear to God I need help,"" said the man quietly on the other end of the line.
The Ethiopian, who calls himself Mike, said he is being held with 450 others in a building inside Myanmar, along the country's border with Thailand.
They are among the thousands of people who have been freed from the notorious scam compounds that have thrived on the border for years, in what appears to be the toughest action so far against the industry along the Thai-Myanmar border.
But many of them are now stranded in Myanmar in makeshift camps because the process of assessing them and arranging flights back to their own countries is so slow.
The armed militia groups who are holding them have a very limited capacity to support so many people – more than 7,000. One of them has said they have stopped freeing people from the compounds because they are not being moved to Thailand fast enough.
The BBC understands that conditions in the camps are unsanitary, food barely sufficient, and many of the freed workers, like Mike, are in poor health. He is suffering from panic attacks, after working for a year in a scam centre where he was routinely beaten.
He told us they got two very basic meals a day, there were only two toilets for 450 people, who he said were now relieving themselves wherever they could.
Mike described being invited a year ago to take up what he was promised would be a good job, in Thailand, requiring only good English language and typing skills.
Instead he found himself subjected to a brutal regime, forced to work long hours every day to meet the target for defrauding people online set by his Chinese bosses.
""It was the worst experience of my life. Of course I was beaten. But believe me I have seen a lot worse done to other people.""
Mike is one of an estimated 100,000 people who are believed to have been lured to work in the scam operations along the Thai-Myanmar border, most of them run by Chinese fraud and gambling operatives who have taken advantage of the lawlessness in this part of Myanmar.
Despite horrifying accounts of abuse from those who escaped in the past, thousands still come from parts of the world where good jobs are scarce, enticed by promises of good money.
China, where many of the scam victims come from, has acted to shut down scam operations along its own border with Myanmar, but until this year neither China nor Thailand had done much about the Thai-Myanmar border.
Ariyan, a young man from Bangladesh, has come back to Thailand to try to help 17 friends who are still there. He said he made a promise to himself to do this after his own gruelling escape from one of the most notorious scam centres last October.
He showed us a brief, shaky video of the compound, still under construction in a remote, forested valley, where he was held, and remembers the terrible treatment he and his friends suffered at the hands of their Chinese boss.
""They gave us a target every week, $5,000. If not, they gave us two electric shocks. Or they put us in a dark room, with no windows. But if we earned a lot of money, they were very happy with us.""
Ariyan had to approach men in the Middle East and lure them into transferring funds to fictitious investments. Using AI, the scammers made him appear on the screen to be an attractive young woman, altering his voice as well.
He says he hated doing it. He remembers one man who was willing to sell his wife's jewellery to fund the fraudulent investment, and wishing he could warn him. But he said the bosses monitored all their calls.
The release of the scam workers started more than two weeks ago after Thailand, under pressure from China and some of its own politicians, cut power and telecommunications links to the compounds on the border.
It limited banking access to the scam bosses and issued arrest warrants for some of the militia leaders who had been protecting the business.
That hit the business, but it also hit the ordinary Karen people who live nearby even harder, putting pressure on the militia commanders to show willingness in ending the abuses in the scam centres. They began helping those trying to escape, and completely evacuating some compounds.
The camp Mike is housed in is now being guarded by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, DKBA, a breakaway insurgent faction of the ethnic Karen community.
Until recently, it was protecting the many scam compounds which have sprung up in its territory. You can see them easily as you drive along the Moei River which divides the two countries - unlikely expanses of new buildings over in war-torn Karen State contrasting with the rural landscape on the Thai side of the border.
Thailand insists it is moving as fast as it can to process the former scam workers and get them home.
A group of 260 freed workers were brought over the Moei River on a raft earlier this month. And around 621 Chinese nationals were flown straight back to China with a police escort on chartered planes. Otherwise, the movement of freed workers to Thailand seems to have stalled.
The problem is that they are from many different countries, some of which are doing little to help get their people home. Around 130 of the first 260 who came over are from Ethiopia, which does not have an embassy in Bangkok.
The BBC has been told that some other African countries will only fly their people home if someone else pays. Most of the freed workers have nothing; even their passports were withheld by the compound bosses.
Thailand fears bringing over thousands of people it will then have to look after indefinitely. It also wants to screen them to find out which are genuine victims of human trafficking and which may have committed criminal acts, but does not have the capacity to do this with such a large group of people.
Different ministries and agencies, including the army, are involved in managing this problem, and have to agree who does what. It does not help that several senior police and immigration officers have been transferred over their alleged involvement in the scam business.
""If this issue is not resolved, then we will not stop working on it – we must work seriously,"" said Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Tuesday in Bangkok. But she was referring to the wider problem of the scam business, not the growing humanitarian crisis among the freed workers.
""Unfortunately, it seems we're in a bit of a standstill,"" says Judah Tana, an Australian who runs an NGO which has for years been helping the victims of trafficking in the scam centres.
""We are hearing distressing information about the lack of sanitation and toilets. Many of the 260 who already came were screened for TB and tested positive. We are hearing from those who are still inside that people are coughing up blood. They are very happy that they have been liberated from the scam compounds, but our worry is that we're not engaging fast enough.""
Thailand now seems ready to bring over one group of 94 Indonesians, as their embassy has been pushing for their release for several days and has booked flights to Indonesia for them.
But that still leaves more than 7,000 still inside Myanmar, unsure what will now happen to them.
Mike told me he and many others with him feared that if they are not allowed to cross into Thailand soon, the DKBA may hand them back to the scam bosses, where they could face punishment for trying to leave.
On Wednesday night his panic attacks and breathing were so bad, he said, they took him to hospital.
""I just want to go home,"" he said over the phone. ""I just want to go back to my country. That is all I am asking.""",0

Jailed Kurdish leader issues call to lay down arms,"Abdullah Ocalan, the jailed leader of the outlawed Kurdish group PKK, has called on his movement to lay down its arms and dissolve itself.
His statement, read out in a letter by MPs from a pro-Kurdish party, was aimed at ending four decades of armed struggle in south-eastern Turkey in which tens of thousands of people have been killed.
Ocalan, 75, had earlier met the MPs for several hours on Imrali, an island in the Sea of Marmara south-west of Istanbul where he has been imprisoned in solitary confinement since 1999.
His announcement came months after ultra-nationalist leader Devlet Bahceli, who is an ally of Turkey's government, launched an initiative to bring an end to the conflict.
""There is no alternative to democracy in the pursuit and realisation of a political system,"" Ocalan's letter read. ""Democratic consensus is the fundamental way.""
The letter was read out by Dem party members Ahmet Turk and Pervin Buldan in both Kurdish and Turkish at a hotel in Istanbul, after their third visit to Imrali island in recent months.
Appealing to members of the PKK - the Kurdistan Workers' Party - Ocalan said ""all groups must lay their arms and the PKK must dissolve itself"".
He said the movement - banned as a terrorist group in Turkey, the EU, UK and US - was formed primarily because ""the channels of democratic politics were closed"".
However, Devlet Bahceli, backed by positive signals from President Recep Tayyip Erdogan and other political parties, had created the right environment for the PKK to lay down its arms, he added.
Bahceli has for years pushed for tough military action against the PKK, but last October he surprised colleagues by shaking hands with MPs from the Dem party in parliament. He then suggested Ocalan could be given parole if he gave up violence and dissolved his armed group.
There was cautious optimism from some quarters that the 40-year conflict would come to an end.
""We'll look at the outcome,"" said a leading member of Erdogan's ruling AKP, Efkan Ala.
The biggest opposition party, the secular CHP, said it would convene a meeting on Thursday evening.
Pervin Buldan and Dem party colleague Sirri Sureyya Onder had already met Ocalan twice in recent weeks, and they have briefed other parties on their visits.
Onder told an audience made up largely of Kurdish politicians and journalists that they were at a positive turning point in history.
Kurdish leaders largely welcomed the statement and local reports said thousands of people gathered to watch the statement on big screens in the cities of Diyarbakir and Van in the predominantly Kurdish south-east.
Read: Who are the Kurds?
However, significant questions remain among both the Kurdish and Turkish public over what the next step might be.
Not everyone was convinced things would change.
Last week a senior PKK commander, Duran Kalkan, warned that the ruling AKP was not looking for a solution but to ""take over, destroy and annihilate"".
Kurdish politicians and journalists had faced a crackdown and the Turkish army was engaged in military operations in Iraqi Kurdistan and north-eastern Syria, he added.
""[Erdogan} is provoking and instigating war like a 'war baron',"" he told a pro-PKK TV channel.
Turkish-backed forces in northeastern Syria have intensified their campaign against Kurdish forces and last month called on Syria's new leaders to eliminate the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces.
Pro-Kurdish politicians have been targeted by a wave of arrests and jail sentences in recent years.
Last year the two leaders of the pro-Kurdish HDP, Selahattin Demirtas and Figen Yuksekdag, were imprisoned for 42 years and 30 years respectively over deadly riots in 2014. They had already been in prison since 2016.
Kurdish politicians said it was a ""black stain"" on Turkey's justice system and the HDP was subsequently reformed as the Dem party.
Some 40,000 people have died since the PKK's insurgency began.
There was a spike in violence in southeastern Turkey from 2015-17 when a two-and-a-half year ceasefire broke down.
More recently, in October the PKK claimed an attack on the Turkish Aerospace Industries (TAI) headquarters near Ankara which left five people dead.
While Ocalan's letter was being read out, the opposition Good party hung a large black banner on its headquarters remembering victims of the PKK: ""We will not forget, we will not let them be forgotten.""",0
"Five years since deadly Delhi riots, many police cases are falling apart","Five years after deadly religious riots engulfed India's capital Delhi, there is no legal closure in sight for the people involved.
A BBC Hindi analysis has found that more than 80% of the cases related to the violence where courts gave decisions have resulted in acquittals or discharges.
More than 50 people, mostly Muslims, were killed after clashes broke out between Hindus and Muslims over a controversial citizenship law in February 2020. The violence - the deadliest the city had seen in decades - stretched on for days, with hundreds of homes and shops set on fire by violent mobs.
The BBC had earlier reported on incidents of police brutality and complicity during the riots. The police have denied any wrongdoing and in their investigation, alleged that the violence was ""pre-planned"" as a part of a larger conspiracy to ""threaten India's unity"" by the people who were protesting against the law.
They registered 758 cases in connection with the investigation and arrested more than 2,000 people. This included 18 student leaders and activists who were arrested in a case that came to be known as the ""main conspiracy case"". They were charged under a draconian anti-terror law that makes it nearly impossible to get bail. Only six of them have been released in five years, and some like activist Umar Khalid are still in jail, waiting for a trial to begin.
BBC Hindi examined the status of all the 758 cases filed in relation to the riots and analysed the 126 cases in which the Karkardooma court in Delhi had given decisions.
More than 80% of these 126 cases resulted in acquittals or discharges as witnesses turned hostile, or did not support the prosecution's case. Only 20 of these cases saw convictions.
Under Indian law, an accused is discharged when a court closes a case without a trial because there isn't sufficient evidence to go ahead. An acquittal is when the court finds the accused not guilty after a full trial.
In 62 of the 758 cases that were filed on charges related to murder, there was only one conviction and four acquittals, data accessed by the BBC through India's Right to Information law shows.
A detailed analysis of the 126 orders also showed that in dozens of cases, the court came down heavily on the Delhi police for lapses in investigations. In some cases, it criticised the police for filing ""predetermined chargesheets"" that ""falsely implicated"" the accused.
In most of the 126 cases, police officials were presented as witnesses to the events. But for various reasons, the court did not find their testimonies credible.
Judges have pointed out inconsistencies in the police statements, delays in identification of the accused by the police and, in some instances, cast doubts over whether policemen were even present when the violence broke out.
In two orders, the judge said that he could not ""restrain"" himself from saying that when history looked back at the riots, the ""failure of the investigating agency to conduct a proper investigation"" would ""torment the sentinels of democracy"". The court was hearing cases filed against three men on charges of arson and looting - but concluded they had been arrested without any ""real or effective investigation"".
The Delhi police did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. In a report filed last April, the police had told the court that all investigations were carried out in a ""credible, fair and impartial"" way.
Testimonies from some of the accused and even the court's own observations, however, raise questions about the investigation.
Shadab Alam, who spent 80 days in jail, says he can never forget the terror of the riots.
He had taken shelter on the rooftop terrace of a medicine store where he worked with a few others.
Just hours earlier, the police had arrived at the shop and asked them to shut it because of ongoing arson.
""Suddenly, they [the police] came again and took a few of us into their van,"" he told the BBC.
When he asked the police why he was being taken, he said, they accused him of participating in rioting.
""They asked us our names and beat us up. Almost all of us arrested were Muslims,"" Mr Alam said. He added that he submitted his medical report before the court that confirmed three injuries.
In its official report, the police charged Mr Alam and 10 other Muslims of burning down a shop. But the court discharged all of them even before the trial could begin.
In its observations, the court criticised the police investigation saying that the witness's statements could have been ""artificially prepared"", and that ""in all probabilities"" the shop was burnt by a ""mob of persons from the Hindu community"".
It said the police did not pursue the case in that direction, despite being present when the incident happened.
Mr Alam had to wait four years for the case to be officially closed.
""All this happened during Covid-19 pandemic. There was a lockdown. We were in a state of frenzy,"" said Dilshad Ali, Alam's father.
""In the end, nothing was proved. But we had to spend so much time and money to prove our innocence.""
He said the family wanted monetary compensation for their losses. ""If the police made a false case against my son, then action should be taken against them,"" he added.
In another case, the court acquitted Sandip Bhati, who was accused of dragging and beating a Muslim man during the riots.
The police had submitted two videos to show Mr Bhati was the culprit. But in court, his lawyer said that the police had submitted an incomplete clip to frame his client.
In the full video, which the BBC has verified, Mr Bhati is seen saving the Muslim man instead of beating him up.
In its order in January, the court ruled that the police ""manipulated"" the video to ""frame"" Mr Bhati instead of tracing the ""actual culprits"".
It also asked the commissioner of Delhi police to take appropriate action against the investigating officer in the case. The police did not respond to BBC Hindi's question on whether this had been done.
Mr Bhati, who spent four months in prison, refused to comment, saying he did not wish to discuss his ""ordeal"".
With so many acquittals, former Supreme Court judge Madan Lokur said, the prosecution and police ""should sit down to introspect what they have achieved in five years"".
He also said that ""accountability needs to be fixed on the prosecution as well if the arrest is found to be illegal or unnecessary"".
""If the prosecution puts someone in jail because they have the power to do so or because they want to do so, they should not be allowed to get away with it if the incarceration is found to be illegal or unnecessary,"" he added.
Even as some cases fall apart in courts, many of those arrested are still languishing in jail awaiting a trial.
Gulfisha Fatima, a 33-year-old PhD aspirant, is among 12 activists who are still in jail on charges of being ""conspirators"" of the riots.
Her family said three other police cases were lodged against her and she got bail in all of them. But she continues to face incarceration in a fourth case under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) - the stringent anti-terror law that sets exceptionally challenging conditions for bail.
""Since she's gone to jail, with every hearing we hope she will finally come out,"" her father Syed Tasneef Hussain told the BBC.
In Ms Fatima's case, after months of hearing the bail plea, the judge from the Delhi High Court got transferred in 2023, and now the entire case is being heard again.
""Sometimes I wonder if I'll be able to see her or if I'll die before that,"" Mr Hussain said.

"'I need help': Freed from Myanmar's scam centres, thousands are now stranded","""I swear to God I need help,"" said the man quietly on the other end of the line.
The Ethiopian, who calls himself Mike, said he is being held with 450 others in a building inside Myanmar, along the country's border with Thailand.
They are among the thousands of people who have been freed from the notorious scam compounds that have thrived on the border for years, in what appears to be the toughest action so far against the industry along the Thai-Myanmar border.
But many of them are now stranded in Myanmar in makeshift camps because the process of assessing them and arranging flights back to their own countries is so slow.
The armed militia groups who are holding them have a very limited capacity to support so many people – more than 7,000. One of them has said they have stopped freeing people from the compounds because they are not being moved to Thailand fast enough.
The BBC understands that conditions in the camps are unsanitary, food barely sufficient, and many of the freed workers, like Mike, are in poor health. He is suffering from panic attacks, after working for a year in a scam centre where he was routinely beaten.
He told us they got two very basic meals a day, there were only two toilets for 450 people, who he said were now relieving themselves wherever they could.
Mike described being invited a year ago to take up what he was promised would be a good job, in Thailand, requiring only good English language and typing skills.
Instead he found himself subjected to a brutal regime, forced to work long hours every day to meet the target for defrauding people online set by his Chinese bosses.
""It was the worst experience of my life. Of course I was beaten. But believe me I have seen a lot worse done to other people.""

Thailand now seems ready to bring over one group of 94 Indonesians, as their embassy has been pushing for their release for several days and has booked flights to Indonesia for them.
But that still leaves more than 7,000 still inside Myanmar, unsure what will now happen to them.

Inside the Taliban's surveillance network monitoring millions,"In a crowded control centre, surrounded by dozens of TV screens, the Taliban's police force proudly shows off its newly-acquired network of 90,000 CCTV cameras - used to watch over the day-to-day lives of millions of people.
""We monitor the entire city of Kabul from here,"" says Khalid Zadran, a spokesperson for the Taliban police chief, pointing to one of the screens.
The authorities say such surveillance will help fight crime, but critics fear it will be used to clamp down on dissent and to monitor the strict morality code enforced by the Islamist Taliban government under their interpretation of Sharia law.
The BBC are the first international journalists allowed to see the system in action.
Inside the control room, police officers sit in rows watching the live streams from thousands of cameras, keeping tabs on the lives of the six million people who live in Kabul.
From car licence plates to facial expressions, everything is monitored.
""In certain neighbourhoods, when we notice groups of people and suspect they might be involved in drug use, criminal activities, or something suspicious, we quickly reach out to the local police,"" says Zadran.
""They arrive swiftly to investigate the nature of the gathering.""
Under the previous government, Kabul was threatened daily with attacks from the Taliban and so-called Islamic State militants, as well as high profile kidnappings and car-jackings. When the Taliban retook power in 2021, they promised to crack down on crime.
The dramatic increase in the number of surveillance cameras in the capital is a sign of growing sophistication in the way the Taliban enforce law and order. Before their return, just 850 cameras were in place in the capital, according to a spokesman for the security forces that were driven from power.
However, in the past three years, the Taliban authorities have also introduced a range of draconian measures limiting people's rights and freedoms, especially those of women. The Taliban government has not been formally recognised by any other country.

The surveillance system the BBC is shown in Kabul features the option to track people by facial recognition. On the corner of one screen images pop up with each face categorised by age range, gender, and whether or not they have a beard or a face mask.
""On clear days, we can zoom in on individuals [who are] kilometres away,"" says Zadran, highlighting a camera positioned up high that focuses on a busy traffic junction.
The Taliban even monitor their own personnel. At a checkpoint, as soldiers popped open the trunk of a car for inspection, the operators focused their lenses, zooming in to scrutinise the contents within.
The interior ministry says the cameras have ""significantly contributed to enhancing safety, curbing crime rates, and swiftly apprehending offenders"". It adds the introduction of CCTV and motorcycle controls have led to a 30% decrease in crime rates between 2023 and 2024 but it is not possible to independently verify these figures.
However, rights groups are concerned about who is being monitored and for how long.
Amnesty International say installing cameras ""under the guise of 'national security' sets a template for the Taliban to continue their draconian policies that violate fundamental rights of people in Afghanistan - especially women in public spaces"".
By law women are not allowed to be heard outside their houses, although in practice this is not being strictly enforced. Teenage girls are prevented from accessing secondary and higher education. Women are barred from many forms of employment. In December, women training as midwives and nurses told the BBC they had been ordered not to return to classes.
While women continue to be visible on the streets of cities like Kabul, they are required to wear a face covering.
Fariba*, a young graduate who lives with her parents in Kabul, has been unable to find work since the Taliban came to power. She tells the BBC there is ""significant concern that surveillance cameras may be used to monitor women's hijabs [veils]"".
The Taliban say only the city police have access to the CCTV system and the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice Ministry – the Taliban's morality police - does not use it.
But Fariba is concerned the cameras will further endanger those opposed to Taliban rule.
""Many individuals, especially ex-military members, human rights advocates and protesting women, struggle to move freely and often live in secrecy,"" she says.
""There is significant concern that surveillance cameras will be used to monitor women's hijabs too,"" she says.
Human Rights Watch, meanwhile, says Afghanistan does not have the data protection laws in place to regulate how the collected CCTV footage is held and used.
The police say the data is kept only for three months, while, according to the interior ministry, the cameras do not pose a threat to privacy as they ""are operated from a special and completely confidential room by a specific and professional person in charge"".
The cameras appear to be Chinese-made. The control room monitors and branding on the feeds the BBC saw carried the name Dahua, a Chinese government-linked company. Earlier reports that the Taliban were in talks with China's Huawei Technologies to buy cameras were denied by the company. Taliban officials refused to answer BBC questions about where they sourced the equipment.
Some of the cost of installing the new network is falling on ordinary Afghans who are being monitored by the system.
In a house in central Kabul the BBC spoke to Shella*, who was asked to pay for some of the cameras installed on the streets near her home.
""They demanded thousands of afghanis from every household,"" she says. It's a large amount in a country where those women who have jobs may earn only around 5,000 afghanis ($68; £54) a month.

The humanitarian situation in Kabul, and in Afghanistan in general, remains precarious after years of war. The country's economy is in crisis, but international aid funding has been largely stopped since the Taliban came back to power.
According to the United Nations, 30 million people are in need of aid.
""If families refused to pay [for the cameras], they were threatened with water and power cuts within three days,"" Shella adds. ""We had to take loans to cover the costs.
""People are starving - what good are these cameras to them?""
The Taliban say that if people do not want to contribute, they can put in an official complaint.
""Participation was voluntary, and donations were in the hundreds, not thousands,"" Khalid Zadran, the Taliban police spokesperson, insists.
Despite the assurances, rights campaigners both inside and outside Afghanistan continue to have concerns over how such a powerful surveillance system will be used.
Jaber, a vegetable seller in Kabul, says the cameras represent another way in which Afghans are made to feel powerless.
""We are treated like trash, denied the opportunity to earn a living, and the authorities regard us as worthless,"" he told the BBC.
""We can do nothing.""

Cook Islands China deal riles allies as West's grip loosens,"The Cook Islands may be small but the ambitions of its leader are mighty.
A range of deals Prime Minister Mark Brown signed with China without consulting the public or New Zealand – an ally to which the Cooks is closely tied – has caused increasing irritation and concern.
The agreements are the first of their kind with a country that is not a traditional ally. They cover infrastructure, ship-building, tourism, agriculture, technology, education and, perhaps crucially, deep-sea mineral exploration.
Brown says his decisions will be based on the ""long-term interests"" of the Cook Islands, which are remote, resource-rich and vulnerable to climate change.
Not everyone agrees with him. The new, wide-ranging deals with Beijing have led to protests on Rarotonga - the largest Cook Island - and a vote of no confidence against Brown in parliament, which he survived earlier this week. They have also worried Australia, another powerful ally.
New Zealand said it was ""blindsided"" by the China deals, but Brown believes his country is independent and does not need to consult Wellington on issues he says are of no concern to them.
He has, nevertheless, tried to reassure Australia and New Zealand that the deals with China don't replace their relationships. But the apparent snub comes at a time when the West's grip on the Pacific seems to be loosening.
The rise of China in the Pacific isn't new. Whether it's bagging a security deal in the Solomon Islands or providing medical services in Tonga, China's presence in the region has been growing. And the US and its allies have made a consistent effort to counter that.
But now there is a new dynamic at play as the Trump administration upends relationships with allies such as Ukraine and appears increasingly unpredictable.
The Cook Islands has had what's known as a ""free association"" relationship with New Zealand, a former coloniser, since the 1960s - meaning Wellington helps on issues like defence and foreign affairs, and that Cook Islanders hold New Zealand citizenship.
The two countries are very close. There are around 15,000 Cook Islanders living in the Pacific island nation, but as many as 100,000 live in New Zealand and Australia. Culturally, Cook Island Māori - who make up the majority of the population - are also closely related to, but distinct from, New Zealand Māori.
The deals with China aren't the only sign that Brown wants to pull away from New Zealand which have caused concern. He recently abandoned a proposal to introduce a Cook Islands passport following a public outcry.
""[The relationship with NZ] connects us politically and connects us to our brothers and sisters of Aotearoa [the Māori word for New Zealand] – they left our shores to sail to Aotearoa. We need to remember that,"" said Cook Islander Jackie Tuara at a recent demonstration against Brown's deals with China.
In a nation that is not used to huge displays of protest, several hundred people gathered outside parliament in Rarotonga, holding up placards that read: ""Stay connected with NZ"". Others waved their New Zealand passports.
""Let us stand in partnership with countries that have the same democratic principles as we are a democratic nation, are we not?"" Ms Tuara said. ""We don't want to see our land and our oceans sold to the highest bidder. Those resources are for us – for our children, for their future.""
But for all those who are opposed to Brown's recent moves away from New Zealand, there are plenty of Cook Islanders who back him.
China specialist Philipp Ivanov, in apparent agreement with the prime minister, says that ""the Pacific island nations have their own agency, their own motivations and their own capabilities"".
He believes that the recent developments in the Cook Islands are ""all part of that little great game that's going on between Australia and China and New Zealand in the Pacific. It's a whack-a-mole kind of game.""
While the US has long been a dominant force in security and military in the region, China has tried to strengthen its ties with the small but strategic Pacific Island nations through aid, infrastructure and security deals.
In response, the likes of the US and the UK have beefed up their diplomatic presence across the region. Australia too has made it clear it will redouble its support. But it's unclear to what extent US President Donald Trump will continue his predecessor's commitments in the region to counter China - and Beijing is taking advantage of that.
Last week, planes flying between New Zealand and Australia were diverted after China conducted military exercises involving live fire. Both Australia and New Zealand had been trailing the three Chinese warships that were making their way down the eastern coast of Australia in what experts say is an escalation and unexpected show of power.
""It's a pretty efficient way of testing the diplomatic response in both the Australia-China and New Zealand-China bilateral relationship, and what the US is prepared to say in defence [of its allies],"" says defence analyst Euan Graham, from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.
""It's also making the point that in the numbers game, China will always be ahead of smaller countries with smaller navies and Australia's navy is at a historic low.""
China's ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, told national broadcaster ABC that Beijing's actions had been appropriate and he won't apologise for it.
Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has been keen to emphasise that no international laws were broken and that the drills were carried out in international waters. Indeed, many have pointed out that Australia and its allies often sail warships through the South China Sea.
""I'd see it as China wanting to capitalise on the chaotic effect that Trump is having right now,"" says Mihai Sora, director of the Pacific Islands programme at Australia's Lowy Institute. ""China is taking advantage of that moment to [say], look Australia, you are actually alone. Where is the United States in all of this?""
Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong freely admits ""we are in a permanent state of contest in our region, that is the reality"".
In speaking out about the warships last week, Australia's government was trying to reassure the public about China's intentions, while also wanting to tell Australians that it's all in hand. That is not a coincidence as Australia heads towards a federal election in the coming months.
""[Opposition leader Peter] Dutton comes from this national security and home affairs background, so the government doesn't want to give him any air to criticise Labor,"" Philipp Ivanov says. ""Being weak on China would be disastrous for them, given what's going on in the US and given our own elections.""
But it also brings into focus the dilemma this part of the world faces.
""Canberra will be contesting every single move that Beijing tries to make … and it reflects the fact that Canberra and Beijing have diverging strategic interests,"" says James Laurenceson, the director of Australia-China Relations Institute at the University of Technology Sydney.
But, he adds, they also have ""enormous commonalities"" - China is Australia's largest trading partner - and New Zealand's - for instance.
""So you've got to be able to ride both these horses at the same time.""
It's not an easy relationship - it never has been. The bigger surprise is that of the US, a traditional ally.
Although many in the Trump administration still describe China as a grave threat, US allies are unsure what to expect from the Washington-Beijing relationship.
And now, as Trump threatens steel and aluminium tariffs and a withdrawal of foreign assistance, Australia feels more isolated than ever. The recent activity of China's warships in the Tasman Sea serves to highlight that isolation.
""I wouldn't think of them as military acts, so much as political acts using military hardware,"" says Mr Sora of the Lowy Institute.
""I think the political act is to say, look, we can do this anytime we want. You can't do anything about it, and the United States is not doing anything about it, because they're busy tearing down the global system.""",0

Qatar Airways says crew handled dead passenger 'appropriately',"Qatar Airways says an internal review has found that its crew ""acted quickly, appropriately and professionally"" when they placed the body of a woman who died mid-flight next to an Australian couple.
The airline issued the statement to the BBC on Friday, after the couple told Australia's Channel Nine that they were traumatised by the experience on the Melbourne to Doha flight.
Qatar Airways had apologised in a previous statement for ""any inconvenience or distress this incident may have caused"".
The incident sparked debate over procedures on dealing with deaths aboard planes.
Mitchell Ring and Jennifer Colin, who were travelling to Venice for a holiday, said the cabin crew had placed the dead woman, covered in blankets, next to Mr Ring for the last four hours of a 14-hour flight.
The cabin crew had trouble moving her body through the aisle to the business class section because ""she was quite a large lady"", Mr Ring said.
They then asked Mr Ring to move over and placed the lady in the seat he was in.
While Ms Colin was invited by another passenger to sit beside her across the aisle, Mr Ring said the plane's staff did not offer to move him elsewhere even though there were vacant seats around.
Qatar Airways said on Friday that the crew's handling of the woman's death was ""in line with training and industry standard practice"".
""Passengers were accommodated to other seats, and a crew member was sitting at all times with the deceased passenger for the duration of the flight until landing in Doha,"" its statement said.
""It is an unfortunate reality that unexpected deaths do sometimes occur on board aircraft across the aviation industry and our crew are highly trained to deal with these situations with as much respect and dignity as possible.""
The airline also said that they have offered support and compensation to the family of the deceased and other passengers who were ""directly affected"" by the incident.
""We totally understand that we can't hold the airline responsible for the poor lady's death, but surely after that there has to be a protocol to look after the customers on board,"" Ms Colin said in the televised interview with Channel 9.
When the plane landed, Mr Ring said passengers were asked to stay put while medical staff and police came on board. Ambulance officers then started pulling blankets off the woman and he saw her face, he said.
""I can't believe they told us to stay,"" he said, adding that he thought they would have let the passengers leave before medical staff arrived.
Barry Eustance, a former Virgin Atlantic captain, earlier told the BBC that in his experience ""the crew would normally try to isolate the body, so there is no passenger exposure to the body and vice versa, for respect and privacy but also for medical reasons"".
According to the guidelines by the International Air Transport Association on dealing with deaths on board a flight, the deceased person should be moved to a seat, preferably one with few other passengers nearby, and covered with a blanket or body bag up to the neck. The body could also be moved to another area that does not obstruct an aisle or exit.
Upon landing, the association recommends that other passengers disembark before the body is attended to by local authorities.

"Death of Hackman and wife 'suspicious enough' for investigation, police say","Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman and his wife appeared to have been dead for ""quite a while"" when the couple and their dog were found on Wednesday afternoon at their home in the US state of New Mexico, police say.
Hackman, 95, was discovered in a side room near the kitchen of the house in Santa Fe, while his wife Betsy Arakawa, a 65-year-old classical pianist, was found in a bathroom.
Authorities reported no signs of injury but deemed the deaths ""suspicious enough"" to investigate and have not ruled out foul play. No cause of death was given.
In a wide-ranging career, Hackman won two Academy Awards for The French Connection and Unforgiven.
Three of Hackman's children from a previous marriage confirmed the death of their father and Ms Arakawa in a statement to the BBC.
""He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us he was always just Dad and Grandpa. We will miss him sorely and are devastated by the loss,"" Elizabeth, Leslie and Annie Hackman said.
Warning: This story contains details some readers may find upsetting
The Santa Fe County Sheriff's office confirmed the deaths.
""On 26 February, 2025, at approximately 1:45pm, Santa Fe County Sheriff's deputies were dispatched to an address on Old Sunset Trail in Hyde Park where Gene Hackman, his wife Betsy Arakawa, and a dog were found deceased,"" the office said.
In a news conference on Thursday afternoon, Sheriff Adan Mendoza said: ""It sounds like they had been deceased for quite a while, and I don't want to guess in reference to how long that was.""
He added: ""There was no immediate sign of foul play. Haven't ruled that out yet.
""This is an investigation, so we're keeping everything on the table.""
A sheriff's detective who responded to the scene said that they believed the couple had been dead for some time because of Ms Arakawa's ""decomposition"" and ""mummification"" in the hands and feet.
""The male decedent also showed obvious signs of death, similar and consistent with the female decedent,"" said the search warrant.
Near Ms Arakawa's head was a portable heater, which the detective determined could have been brought down in the event that she abruptly fell to the ground.
Authorities say they have requested carbon monoxide and toxicology tests for both Hackman and his wife, and that a cause of death has not yet been determined as they await the results of the autopsy.
A prescription bottle and scattered pills were on the bathroom countertop close to her body. The couple's German Shepherd dog was found dead in a bathroom closet near to Ms Arakawa.
Hackman was discovered wearing grey tracksuit bottoms, a blue long-sleeve T-shirt and brown slippers. Sunglasses and a walking cane were next to the body.
The detective suspected that the actor had fallen suddenly.
The circumstances of their death were ""suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation"", said the search warrant, because the person who called emergency services found the front door of the property open.
But the detective observed no sign of forced entry into the home. Nothing appeared out of place inside. Neither was there any indication that belongings had been rummaged through, or that any items had been removed.
Two other, healthy dogs were discovered roaming the property - one inside and one outside.
The couple's 2,300 sq ft ranch-style home, part of a gated community, was valued at around $1m, according to tax records.
The local utility responded and found no sign of a gas leak in the area. The fire department detected no indication of a carbon monoxide leak or poisoning, according to the search warrant.
The detective spoke at the scene to two maintenance workers, one of whom had called the emergency services.
The two workers said they sometimes conducted routine work at the property, but rarely ever saw the couple.
They indicated that they communicated with them by phone and text, primarily with Ms Arakawa.
The two workers said they last had contact with the couple two weeks beforehand.
A recording of the 911 call obtained by the BBC shows the emotional caller telling a dispatcher how he found the two bodies.
""No, they're not moving,"" he says in the audio. ""Just send somebody out here really quick.""
The person, who made the call while standing outside the property and peering in through a window, is heard saying ""damn"" repeatedly.
Hackman met Ms Arakawa when she was working part-time at a California gym in the mid-1980s, the New York Times has previously reported.
He won the best actor Oscar for his role as Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle in William Friedkin's 1971 thriller The French Connection, and another for best supporting actor for playing Little Bill Daggett in Clint Eastwood's Western film Unforgiven in 1992.
A relative latecomer to Hollywood, Hackman's breathrough came in his thirties, when he was nominated for an Oscar for portraying Buck Barrow in 1967's Bonnie and Clyde - opposite Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway - and again for I Never Sang for My Father in 1970.
Both films saw him recognised in the supporting actor category. He was also nominated for best leading actor in 1988 for playing the FBI agent in Mississippi Burning.
He played more than 100 roles during his career, including supervillain Lex Luthor in the Christopher Reeve-starring Superman movies in the 1970s and 1980s.
Hackman featured opposite many other Hollywood heavyweights including Al Pacino in 1973's Scarecrow and Gene Wilder in 1974's Young Frankenstein.
His last big-screen appearance came as Monroe Cole in Welcome to Mooseport in 2004, after which he stepped back from Hollywood for a quieter life in New Mexico.",0
Trump commends Zelensky ahead of White House talks,"US President Donald Trump has said he has a ""lot of respect"" for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, on the eve of their talks at the White House.
Asked by the BBC if he would apologise for recently calling him a ""dictator"", he said he could not believe he had said this. He also called Zelensky ""very brave"".
Trump was speaking after talks with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer about ending the war between Ukraine and Russia.
He predicted a ""very good meeting"" with Zelensky on Friday, saying efforts to achieve peace were ""moving along pretty rapidly"".
This week's meetings come after the Trump administration shocked its Western partners by holding the first high-level US talks with Moscow since Russia invaded Ukraine just over three years ago.
America's new president had appeared to blame Zelensky for the war and chided him for not starting peace talks earlier.
""You've been there for three years,"" he had said last Tuesday. ""You should have ended it... You should have never started it. You could have made a deal.""
But this Thursday, speaking after meeting Sir Keir, Trump told reporters asking about his forthcoming talks with Zelensky: ""I think we're going to have a very good meeting tomorrow morning. We're going to get along really well.""
Asked by the BBC's Chris Mason if he still thought Zelensky was a ""dictator"", he replied: ""Did I say that? I can't believe I said that.""
Zelensky will be hoping to win some kind of security guarantees for his country that would underpin any peace deal that may be negotiated.
Asked about these on Thursday, Trump only said he was ""open to many things"" but he wanted to get Russia and Ukraine to agree a deal before deciding what measures might be put in place to enforce it.
On his visit on Friday, Zelensky is expected to sign a deal that will give the US access to Ukraine's rare earth mineral resources.
Trump suggested that the presence of US mining concerns in Ukraine would act as a deterrent against future Russian attacks on Ukraine.
""It's a backstop, you could say,"" he said on Thursday. ""I don't think anybody's going to play around if we're there with a lot of workers and having to do with rare earths and other things which we need for our country.""
The British prime minister had said earlier that the UK was prepared to send troops to Ukraine after the war as part of a peacekeeping force but only if the US, Nato's leading member, provided a ""backstop"".
Asked if the US would aid British peacekeepers if they were attacked by Russia, Trump said: ""The British have incredible soldiers, incredible military and they can take care of themselves. But if they need help, I'll always be with the British, okay?""
Nato's Article 5 holds that Nato members will come to the defence of an ally which comes under attack.
Praising Trump's ""personal commitment to bring peace"" in Ukraine, Sir Keir said the UK was ""ready to put boots on the ground and planes in the air to support a deal"".
""We're focused now on bringing an enduring end to the barbaric war in Ukraine,"" he said.
But, he added, it must not be a peace deal ""that rewards the aggressor or that gives encouragement to regimes like Iran"".
Asked whether Vladimir Putin was trustworthy, the UK prime minister said his views on the Russian president were well-known.
Asked in turn why he seemed to trust Putin and Sir Keir did not, Trump said: ""I know a lot of people that you would say no chance that they would ever deceive you, and they are the worst people in the world.
""I know others that you would guarantee they would deceive you, and you know what, they're 100% honourable, so you never know what you're getting.""
EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, who had been due to meet US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Washington before he cancelled the talks ""due to scheduling issues"", told BBC News that Putin and Russia did ""not want to have peace"".
""For any peace agreement to function, it needs the Europeans as well as Ukrainians on board,"" she added.
Stopping off in the Irish Republic on Thursday en route to the US, Zelensky met the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Micheál Martin at Shannon Airport.
""We discussed the steps to end the war with guaranteed peace for Ukraine and the whole of Europe,"" he said later.
Following the overthrow of Ukraine's pro-Russian president in 2014, Moscow annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and backed pro-Russian separatists in bloody fighting in eastern Ukraine.
The conflict burst into all-out war when Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022.
It is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people, most of them soldiers, have been killed or injured, and millions of Ukrainian civilians have fled as refugees.
As well as Crimea, Russia now occupies parts of four other regions - Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.
The Kremlin warned on Thursday that Russia would make no territorial concessions to Ukraine as part of a peace deal.
""All territories that have become subjects of the Russian Federation... are an integral part of our country, Russia,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. ""This is an absolutely indisputable fact and a non-negotiable fact.""
Separately, Russian and US officials met in the Turkish city of Istanbul for talks on rebuilding diplomatic ties.

Key takeaways from Starmer's talks with Trump,"UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has met US President Donald Trump during his first visit to the White House.
Here are some of the key moments as the pair took questions from reporters before and after the talks.
Sir Keir did not turn up to the meeting empty-handed.
Part way through their opening remarks, the prime minister reached inside his jacket pocket and pulled out an official letter from King Charles III - an invitation for a second state visit.
Trump appeared to be genuinely taken back for a few seconds, asking: ""Am I supposed to read it right now?""
After taking a minute to read the letter, Trump said he accepted the invite and that it would be an ""honour"" to visit the ""fantastic"" country.
He added that King Charles was a ""beautiful man, a wonderful man"".
During Trump's first term as president, he met King Charles's mother, the late Queen Elizabeth II, during a three-day state visit in 2019.
Sir Keir said Thursday's invitation to host Trump once more for a second full state visit was ""unprecedented"".
While cordial, the initial meeting in the Oval Office between Sir Keir and Trump left no doubt that the US president hoped to be firmly in charge.
The meeting was a pattern we've now seen six times with foreign leaders at the Trump White House, including with French President Emmanuel Macron earlier this week: Trump taking control of the room and using the opportunity to get his own messages, both domestic and international, across to the reporters there.
During their half-hour session, Trump leaned forward and slightly towards Sir Keir - wearing a nearly identical, but slightly different coloured tie to Trump's - dominating the conversation and taking charge of calling on reporters.
A joint afternoon news conference later began with a slightly more diplomatic and matter-of-fact tone, with both Trump and Sir Keir standing at their respective lecterns and going to considerable lengths to lavish praise on the other.
Trump joked he would have been president 20 years ago with Sir Keir's ""beautiful"" accent.
At one point, Sir Keir was asked about Trump's controversial call to make Canada – a member of the Commonwealth – the 51st state of the US.
""I think you're trying to find a divide that doesn't exist,"" Sir Keir replied.
Trump interjected quickly with the words ""that's enough"" before moving on – again taking control of the room as he stood next to a visibly surprised Sir Keir.
To put it gently, Sir Keir and Trump are from different schools of politics - both in their style and substance.
But asked to name their similarities Trump said: ""He loves his country, and so do I.""
What else do they share? Trump said ""we like each other, frankly, and we like each other's country"".
But the ""common thread"" between the two men was that ""we love our country"", Trump said.
Sir Keir had a number of tricky topics to raise with Trump - from trade to US security guarantees for Ukraine - and at the beginning of their news conference he called his counterpart ""a very tough negotiator"".
Asked if the prime minister had convinced him not to impose trade tariffs on the UK, Trump said ""he tried"", adding: ""He was working hard, I'll tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there.""
But he has said there was ""a very good chance"" of a trade deal ""where tariffs wouldn't be necessary"".
Such a deal, Trump said, could be made ""pretty quickly"".
Sir Keir spoke of a ""new economic deal with advanced technology at its core"".
Trump said he was ""inclined to go along with"" the UK's Chagos Islands deal.
The UK is in talks with Mauritius about handing over the territory but continuing to lease one of the islands, Diego Garcia, which contains a UK-US military airbase.
The agreement has been mired in uncertainty after Trump's re-election as US president, given several US Republicans have argued it could deliver a potential security boost to China.
But during the meeting, Trump said he had a ""feeling"" the deal was going to ""work out very well"".
Last week, Trump made headlines by calling Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a ""dictator"" in a social media post, echoing Russian claims about Kyiv's cancelled elections.
An election was scheduled for May 2024, but it was suspended because Ukraine has been under martial law since Russia began its full-scale invasion.
Asked by the BBC's Chris Mason about his use of the word ""dictator"", Trump replied: ""Did I say that? I can't believe I would say that.""
In the news conference later, Trump also appeared to have softened his attitude to Zelensky, praising him as ""very brave"" and saying the pair got on ""really well"".
Talking about the potential for a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia, Trump said ""progress towards peace"" would continue when Zelensky visits the White House on Friday. The two are expected to sign a major minerals deal.
At the Munich Security Conference last week, US Vice President JD Vance attacked the UK and other European democracies, warning that ""free speech is in retreat.""
Asked about the comments, Trump called on his deputy to defend himself. Vance argued ""there have been infringements on free speech that actually affect not just the British"" but also ""American technology companies and by extension, American citizens"".
That led to Sir Keir cutting in, saying ""we've had free speech for a very, very long time in the United Kingdom - and it will last for a very, very long time"".
He rejected Vance's claim, saying ""in relation to free speech in the UK, I'm very proud of our history there"".",0
Japanese woman under investigation for kissing BTS's Jin,"A Japanese woman who unexpectedly kissed K-pop boy band BTS's Jin at a fan event last year has found herself under investigation by South Korean police.
South Korean police have called for the woman - who is currently in Japan - to come forward for questioning on charges of sexual harrassment in a public space.
The incident happened during the K-pop idol's first public event in Seoul last June which saw him hug 1,000 fans. Instead of just hugging the star, the woman appeared to have kissed his face, with Jin responding by turning his face away.
The kiss angered other BTS fans, one of whom filed a criminal complaint against her, leading police to launch an investigation.
On 13 June, 2024, the day after he was discharged from the army, Jin, whose real name is Kim Seok-jin, held a fan event where he hugged 1,000 fans and performed songs in front of 3,000 others.
During the three-hour long ""hugathon"", fans who won the chance to embrace him queued up and went on stage one by one to meet the 33-year-old star.
But one of them caused an uproar when she appeared to kiss Jin's face.
Clips of the moment went viral on the internet. Videos show that Jin, taken aback by the move, tried to turn his head while hugging the woman before quickly moving on to the next fan. Fans could also be seen reacting angrily to her actions.
She later wrote on her blog later that she kissed him ""on his neck"" and ""the skin was very soft"".
The woman's identity has not been revealed but police added that they had identified her with the assistance from their Japanese counterparts.
The BBC has reached out to BTS' agency HYBE for comment.
Jin is the first BTS member to have been discharged from military duty. He was followed by J-Hope who was discharged in October. The other four - V, RM, Jimin, Jungkook and Suga - are still serving and the band is expected to reunite only in June 2025.
K-pop idols are known for having a close relationship with their fanbases through various communication channels and events. It's common for artists to communicate with fans through social media livestream chats and in-person events to cultivate loyal fans.
But fans and agencies have increasingly been aware of some toxic fan cultures as well. For example, many artists have been vocal about the stress caused by ""sasaeng fans"", who are overly obsessed with their idols that would stalk and harass the artists.",0
Notorious Mexican drug lord among 29 extradited to US,"Mexico has extradited 29 alleged drug cartel members to the United States – including high-profile gang leaders.
Those extradited include notorious drug lord Rafael Caro Quintero who has been wanted by the US for the murder of an American agent 40 years ago.
The move – considered to be of the biggest extraditions in Mexico's history – is seen as a major step in bilateral security relations between the two countries.
It comes after US President Donald Trump threatened earlier this year to impose tariffs on imports from Mexico, accusing it of failing to tackle drug trafficking and mass migration.
""As President Trump has made clear, cartels are terrorist groups, and this Department of Justice is devoted to destroying cartels and transnational gangs,"" US Attorney General Pam Bondi said in a statement on Thursday night.
""We will prosecute these criminals to the fullest extent of the law in honour of the brave law enforcement agents who have dedicated their careers – and in some cases, given their lives – to protect innocent people from the scourge of violent cartels,"" she added.
Caro Quintero is one of the founding members of the Guadalajara Cartel and a linchpin in the creation of modern Mexican drug-trafficking.
He was wanted in the US in connection with the torture and murder of a Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) agent, Enrique 'Kiki' Camarena in 1985.
Caro Quintero was arrested at the time and spent 28 years in prison in Mexico before being released in 2013 – much to the anger of the Americans.
But in 2022, aged in his 70s he was recaptured by the Mexican Navy after a dog found him hiding in bushes.
Reacting to Caro Quintero's extradition DEA Acting Administrator Derek Maltz hailed the move as a ""victory for the Camarena family"".
He added: ""Today sends a message to every cartel leader, every trafficker, every criminal poisoning our communities: You will be held accountable.
""No matter how long it takes, no matter how far you run, justice will find you.""
Quintero is expected to appear in court in New York on Friday.
Other fugitives extradited include the founders of the brutal Zetas Cartel - Miguel Angel Treviño and his brother Omar Treviño.
Known as Z-40 and Z-42 respectively, the two men ran the feared organisation for years before its eventual demise in the mid 2010s.
Miguel Treviño, who was arrested by Mexican marines in July 2013, was wanted on both sides of the border for ordering massacres and running drugs on a global scale.
Omar Treviño - who was wanted in the US and Mexico on charges of drug trafficking, kidnap and murder - was captured by security forces in Monterrey in March 2015.
Their criminal empire spanned a wide range of illicit activities including cocaine-smuggling, people trafficking, extortion, gun-running and kidnappings.
Police in Webb County, Texas, confirmed the brothers extradition and warned Americans from crossing into Mexico for fear of reprisals.",0
Cook Islands China deal riles allies as West's grip loosens,"The Cook Islands may be small but the ambitions of its leader are mighty.
A range of deals Prime Minister Mark Brown signed with China without consulting the public or New Zealand – an ally to which the Cooks is closely tied – has caused increasing irritation and concern.
The agreements are the first of their kind with a country that is not a traditional ally. They cover infrastructure, ship-building, tourism, agriculture, technology, education and, perhaps crucially, deep-sea mineral exploration.
Brown says his decisions will be based on the ""long-term interests"" of the Cook Islands, which are remote, resource-rich and vulnerable to climate change.
Not everyone agrees with him. The new, wide-ranging deals with Beijing have led to protests on Rarotonga - the largest Cook Island - and a vote of no confidence against Brown in parliament, which he survived earlier this week. They have also worried Australia, another powerful ally.
New Zealand said it was ""blindsided"" by the China deals, but Brown believes his country is independent and does not need to consult Wellington on issues he says are of no concern to them.
He has, nevertheless, tried to reassure Australia and New Zealand that the deals with China don't replace their relationships. But the apparent snub comes at a time when the West's grip on the Pacific seems to be loosening.
The rise of China in the Pacific isn't new. Whether it's bagging a security deal in the Solomon Islands or providing medical services in Tonga, China's presence in the region has been growing. And the US and its allies have made a consistent effort to counter that.
But now there is a new dynamic at play as the Trump administration upends relationships with allies such as Ukraine and appears increasingly unpredictable.
The Cook Islands has had what's known as a ""free association"" relationship with New Zealand, a former coloniser, since the 1960s - meaning Wellington helps on issues like defence and foreign affairs, and that Cook Islanders hold New Zealand citizenship.
The two countries are very close. There are around 15,000 Cook Islanders living in the Pacific island nation, but as many as 100,000 live in New Zealand and Australia. Culturally, Cook Island Māori - who make up the majority of the population - are also closely related to, but distinct from, New Zealand Māori.
The deals with China aren't the only sign that Brown wants to pull away from New Zealand which have caused concern. He recently abandoned a proposal to introduce a Cook Islands passport following a public outcry.
""[The relationship with NZ] connects us politically and connects us to our brothers and sisters of Aotearoa [the Māori word for New Zealand] – they left our shores to sail to Aotearoa. We need to remember that,"" said Cook Islander Jackie Tuara at a recent demonstration against Brown's deals with China.
In a nation that is not used to huge displays of protest, several hundred people gathered outside parliament in Rarotonga, holding up placards that read: ""Stay connected with NZ"". Others waved their New Zealand passports.
""Let us stand in partnership with countries that have the same democratic principles as we are a democratic nation, are we not?"" Ms Tuara said. ""We don't want to see our land and our oceans sold to the highest bidder. Those resources are for us – for our children, for their future.""
But for all those who are opposed to Brown's recent moves away from New Zealand, there are plenty of Cook Islanders who back him.
China specialist Philipp Ivanov, in apparent agreement with the prime minister, says that ""the Pacific island nations have their own agency, their own motivations and their own capabilities"".
He believes that the recent developments in the Cook Islands are ""all part of that little great game that's going on between Australia and China and New Zealand in the Pacific. It's a whack-a-mole kind of game.""
While the US has long been a dominant force in security and military in the region, China has tried to strengthen its ties with the small but strategic Pacific Island nations through aid, infrastructure and security deals.
In response, the likes of the US and the UK have beefed up their diplomatic presence across the region. Australia too has made it clear it will redouble its support. But it's unclear to what extent US President Donald Trump will continue his predecessor's commitments in the region to counter China - and Beijing is taking advantage of that.

""It's a pretty efficient way of testing the diplomatic response in both the Australia-China and New Zealand-China bilateral relationship, and what the US is prepared to say in defence [of its allies],"" says defence analyst Euan Graham, from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.
""It's also making the point that in the numbers game, China will always be ahead of smaller countries with smaller navies and Australia's navy is at a historic low.""
China's ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, told national broadcaster ABC that Beijing's actions had been appropriate and he won't apologise for it.
Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has been keen to emphasise that no international laws were broken and that the drills were carried out in international waters. Indeed, many have pointed out that Australia and its allies often sail warships through the South China Sea.
""I'd see it as China wanting to capitalise on the chaotic effect that Trump is having right now,"" says Mihai Sora, director of the Pacific Islands programme at Australia's Lowy Institute. ""China is taking advantage of that moment to [say], look Australia, you are actually alone. Where is the United States in all of this?""
Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong freely admits ""we are in a permanent state of contest in our region, that is the reality"".
In speaking out about the warships last week, Australia's government was trying to reassure the public about China's intentions, while also wanting to tell Australians that it's all in hand. That is not a coincidence as Australia heads towards a federal election in the coming months.
""[Opposition leader Peter] Dutton comes from this national security and home affairs background, so the government doesn't want to give him any air to criticise Labor,"" Philipp Ivanov says. ""Being weak on China would be disastrous for them, given what's going on in the US and given our own elections.""
But it also brings into focus the dilemma this part of the world faces.
""Canberra will be contesting every single move that Beijing tries to make … and it reflects the fact that Canberra and Beijing have diverging strategic interests,"" says James Laurenceson, the director of Australia-China Relations Institute at the University of Technology Sydney.
But, he adds, they also have ""enormous commonalities"" - China is Australia's largest trading partner - and New Zealand's - for instance.
""So you've got to be able to ride both these horses at the same time.""
It's not an easy relationship - it never has been. The bigger surprise is that of the US, a traditional ally.
Although many in the Trump administration still describe China as a grave threat, US allies are unsure what to expect from the Washington-Beijing relationship.
And now, as Trump threatens steel and aluminium tariffs and a withdrawal of foreign assistance, Australia feels more isolated than ever. The recent activity of China's warships in the Tasman Sea serves to highlight that isolation.
""I wouldn't think of them as military acts, so much as political acts using military hardware,"" says Mr Sora of the Lowy Institute.
""I think the political act is to say, look, we can do this anytime we want. You can't do anything about it, and the United States is not doing anything about it, because they're busy tearing down the global system.""",0
Volcano owners' conviction over deadly eruption thrown out,"The owners of a New Zealand volcano that erupted in 2019, killing 22 people, have had their conviction over the disaster thrown out by the country's High Court.
Whakaari Management Limited (WML) was found guilty in 2023 of failing to keep visitors safe and fined just over NZ$1m ($560,000; £445,000). They were also ordered to pay NZ$4.8m in reparation to the victims.
However, following an appeal, the High Court ruled on Friday that the company only owned the land and were not responsible for people's safety.
White Island, which is also known by its Māori name, Whakaari, is New Zealand's most active volcano and has been erupting in some form since 2011.
It had been showing signs of heightened unrest for weeks before the fatal December 2019 eruption, which killed almost half of the people who were on it at the time. Most were tourists, including 17 from Australia and three from the US.
Another 25 people were injured, with many suffering extensive burns.
High Court Justice Simon Moore said on Friday that while WML licensed tours of the volcano, there was nothing in these agreements that gave the company control of what was happening on the island day to day.
He agreed that it was reasonable for the company to rely on tour operators, as well as emergency management and science organisations, to assess risks to safety.
Justice Moore added that, in coming to his decision, he had not ignored the pain and grief of the families that had been affected.
""It is impossible not to be deeply moved and affected by the sheer scale and nature of the human loss in this case,"" he said.
Thirteen parties in total, including tour operators, were charged over the disaster. WML was the last to receive a verdict after six had pleaded guilty, while six more had their charges dismissed.
The case against WML was the largest action of its kind brought by New Zealand's regulator, Worksafe NZ, who said it acknowledged the High Court ruling and was considering whether to appeal.
James Cairney, a lawyer for James, Andrew and Peter Buttle - three brothers who own the company - said the family welcomed the decision, Radio New Zealand reported. He added that the Buttles hoped it would ""bring certainty for all landowners who grant others recreational access to their land"".
The Buttle family has owned Whakaari/White Island since the 1930s, when their grandfather bought it and placed it in a family trust. It is one of only a few privately owned islands in New Zealand.
The brothers had previously been on trial in relation to the 2019 disaster as individuals over alleged breaches of New Zealand's workplace health and safety legislation. Those charges were dismissed in 2023.",0
Seven planets to be visible in night sky for last time until 2040,"Skywatchers are in for a treat this week as seven planets - Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, Venus, Neptune, Mercury, and Saturn will all be briefly visible in the evening sky.
This phenomenon, known as a 'planetary parade' is a rare sight, and it will be the last time seven planets can be seen simultaneously so well until 2040.
The best chance to see as many planets as possible will be just after sunset on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.
Four of the planets - Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Mars - will be visible to the naked eye. Saturn will be harder to see because it will be low in the horizon. You will need a telescope to spot the other two planets - Uranus and Neptune.
A good view of the horizon and clear skies will offer the best chance of spotting them all. However, the window to see all seven planets will be very brief.
Dr Edward Bloomer, astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich said: ""There's a rare opportunity to have seven planets in essentially a convenient place for you to look for them.""
As the sun sets, Saturn and Mercury will also be setting, making them particularly difficult to see.
""You really only have a few minutes after sunset to catch them before they drop below the horizon. After that, you'll still be able to see Venus, Jupiter, and Mars clearly for a much longer time,"" Dr Bloomer added.
The planets in our solar system orbit the Sun within roughly the same flat plane as the Earth.
As they orbit at different speeds and distances from the Sun, there are moments when they appear to line up from Earth's perspective creating a spectacular visual display, although the planets remain separated by vast distances in space.
Venus and Jupiter will be the easiest to spot due to their brightness, while Mars will have a distinct reddish hue.
""Uranus is technically visible with the naked eye, but you'd need perfect eyesight and ideal conditions,"" Dr Bloomer explains.
To improve your chances of seeing as many planets as possible, Dr Bloomer advises heading to a location with a clear view of the horizon and minimal light pollution.
""If you just pop out of your kitchen into your back garden, you will take time to adjust to the light levels. Give it a bit of time - your eyes take about half an hour to fully adjust,"" said Dr Bloomer.
""Avoid looking at your phone, get comfortable, and ensure you have an unobstructed view of the horizon.""
While this is an exciting opportunity, Dr Bloomer encourages people to make a habit of gazing at the night sky.
""See how things change,"" he said, adding that observing the heavens is ""a chance to witness the ongoing mechanics of the solar system at work.""

On Wednesday night, skies will be generally cloudier with showery rain at times.
By Thursday, expect a drier, clearer view of the night sky. Earlier in the evening is best, as mist and fog patches may develop further into the night.
For Friday high pressure is expected to dominate, keeping dry conditions for most with clear spells. Soon after sunset is most favoured as mist and fog patches may develop later.

Japan's MeToo icon is up for an Oscar - but the film can't air in the country,"When Japanese journalist Shiori Ito decided to speak up about her rape allegations, she knew she was standing in the face of a society that preferred silence.
""I'm scared…but all I want to do is to talk about the truth"", Shiori says in the opening scene of her Oscar-nominated documentary Black Box Diaries.
Shiori became the face of Japan's MeToo movement after she accused a prominent journalist Noriyuki Yamaguchi of rape.
Her acclaimed directorial debut, based on her memoir of the same name, is a retelling of her quest for justice after authorities found the evidence insufficient to pursue criminal charges.
But there is one country where it is yet to play: Japan, where it has run into huge controversy. Her former lawyers have accused her of including audio and video footage she did not have permission to use, which, they say, has violated trust and put her sources at risk. Shiori defends what she did as necessary for ""public good"".
It's a startling turn in a story that gripped Japan when it first broke -the then 28-year-old Shiori ignored her family's request to remain silent. And after her public accusation did not result in a criminal case, she filed a civil lawsuit against Yamaguchi and won $30,000 (£22,917) in damages.
Shiori told the BBC making the film involved ""reliving her trauma"": ""It took me four years [to make the film] because emotionally I was struggling.""
She was an intern at Reuters news agency in 2015, when she says Yamaguchi invited her to discuss a job opportunity. He was the Washington bureau chief for a major Japanese media firm, Tokyo Broadcasting System.
Shiori claims she was raped following a dinner in Tokyo with Yamaguchi, who has always denied the allegations.
CCTV footage of an intoxicated Shiori being dragged from a taxi and into a hotel is part of the more than 400 hours of footage she edited for the documentary.
The editing process, she says, was ""really challenging. It was like hardcore exposure therapy.""
When the film was released, the CCTV footage became a source of friction as Shiori's team of ex-lawyers, who helped her win her lawsuit, slammed the documentary.
They claimed it was unauthorised use of CCTV footage - and that she had violated a pledge not to use it outside of court proceedings. .
Last week, her former lawyers – led by Yoko Nishihiro - held another press conference, saying her use of the footage posed challenges for other sexual assault cases.
""If the fact that the evidence from the trial has been made public is known, we will be unable to obtain cooperation in future cases,"" Ms Nishihiro said.
Ms Nishihiro claimed that Shiori had also used unauthorised recordings, saying she only found this out at a screening of the film last July.
This included audio of a police detective who eventually acted as a whistleblower about the investigation process – as well as a video of a taxi driver who provided testimony about the night of the alleged rape. Both of them, the lawyers argued, were identifiable and neither had given their consent to be featured in the film.
""I've been trying so hard to protect her for eight-and-half years, and I feel like I've been completely torn apart,"" Ms Nishihiro said.
""I want her to explain and be held accountable.""
Shiori had earlier acknowledged that she did not have the hotel's permission to use the CCTV but argued that this was ""the only visual evidence"" she had of the night she was sexually assaulted.
She added that including audio of the police detective was necessary because of ""the cover up of the investigation"", adding that she was releasing the video ""for the public good"".
""We are standing in different points of view,"" she said of the fallout with her former lawyers.
""For me, [it's for the] public good. For them, it's 'do not break any rules'.""
There has been no official explanation as to why the film has not yet been distributed. Shiori has said that ""Japan is still not ready to talk about [it]"", but its unclear how much of it is also due to legal hurdles.
In her latest statement last week, Shiori apologised and said she would re-edit parts of the documentary to make sure individuals would not be identified, adding that a redacted version would be screened moving forward.
""There are moments I wish I didn't have to put in [the documentary]. There are moments I'm not proud of but I wanted to put all of it and to show we are also human,"" she told the BBC. ""No-one is perfect.""
In the nine years since the assault, Shiori's fight against Japan's justice system has been well-chronicled in the media - and is something she says she wanted to detail in her documentary.
She was met with a wave of backlash when she went public in 2017, receiving hate mail and online abuse.
""People were telling me you're not crying enough… you're not wearing proper clothes... you're too strong.""
Some criticised the way she was dressed at the press conference where she first accused Yamaguchi – they said her shirt had been buttoned too low down. Shiori said she left Japan for a few months, fearing for her safety.
Shiori's case was followed by other high-profile cases. In 2023, former soldier Rina Gonoi also went public with her story, accusing three ex-soldiers of sexually assaulting her. This was the year Japan passed landmark laws to redefine rape from ""forcible sexual intercourse"" to ""non-consensual sexual intercourse"" and raised the age of consent from 13 to 16.
Gonoi eventually won her case but Shiori says it is proof that speaking up against sexual violence comes at a price, adding: ""Is it worth going through this as a survivor seeking justice? It shouldn't be this way. You have to sacrifice a lot.""
For now it's unclear if her film will ever be screened in Japan, but she says that its homecoming would be her ultimate prize.
""This is my love letter to Japan. I really wish one day I can screen my film, and my family can also watch it,"" she added.
""That's what I really hope for… more than winning an Oscar.""",0
Gene Hackman's daughters and Clint Eastwood lead tributes to star,"Gene Hackman's daughters and granddaughter say they are ""devastated"" and will ""miss him sorely"", as they led tributes to the movie star who has died aged 95.
Hackman was found dead along with his wife Betsy Arakawa and their dog at his home in New Mexico, US. No cause of death was given, but police said the situation was ""suspicious enough"" to merit investigation.
In a statement, daughters Elizabeth and Leslie, and granddaughter Annie said: ""He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us he was always just dad and grandpa.""
Morgan Freeman who co-starred with Hackman in the 1992 movie Unforgiven - for which Hackman won an Oscar - described the actor as ""incredibly gifted"" while the movie's director Clint Eastwood said he was ""extremely saddened"" by the news.
Ralph Fiennes - nominated for an Oscar this year for Conclave - paid tribute to the late actor with a black and white portrait of a smiling Hackman, simply titled Gene Hackman 1930-2025.
Viola Davis called Hackman ""one of the greats"" while Tom Hanks posted on Instagram that: ""There has never been a 'Gene Hackman Type.' There has only been Gene Hackman.""
The Prince of Wales also issued a statement saying he was ""so sad to hear the news"".
""Hackman was a true genius of film who brought each and every character to life with power, authenticity and star quality,"" added Prince William, who is also president of Bafta.
Hackman's 1978 Superman co-star Valerie Perrine labelled him ""a genius"", while the Guardian's film critic said his death ""marks the end"" of the era of American new wave cinema.
The Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola, who worked with Hackman on the 1974 mystery thriller The Conversation, called Hackman ""a great artist"".
In a statement posted on Instagram, Coppola said: ""Gene Hackman a great actor, inspiring and magnificent in his work and complexity.
""I mourn his loss, and celebrate his existence and contribution.""
Hackman, who won two Oscars for his work on The French Connection and Clint Eastwood's Western Unforgiven, played more than 100 roles across his career.
They included supervillain Lex Luthor in the Christopher Reeve-starring Superman movies in the 1970s and 1980s.
Perrine, who acted opposite Hackman as his character's on-screen girlfriend Eve Teschmacher, described the late actor as ""a genius"" and one of the ""greatest to grace the silver screen"".
She posted on X: ""His performances are legendary. His talent will be missed. Goodbye my sweet Lex Till we meet again.""
Hackman appeared alongside Hollywood heavyweights including Al Pacino in 1973's Scarecrow, Gene Wilder in 1974's Young Frankenstein and Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton in 1981's Reds.
He also starred in the hit movies Runaway Jury and Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums.
The British Academy of Film and Television, said it was ""saddened"" to hear of Hackman's death, describing him as a ""much-celebrated"" actor with an ""illustrious"" career.
Spanish actor Antonio Banderas described it as being ""a very sad day for the cinema's family"".
Hank Azaria, the actor best known for voicing characters in The Simpsons, said ""it was an honour and an education working with Gene Hackman"" on 1996's The Birdcage.
""Mike Nichols said of his genius character acting: 'He always brought just enough of a different part of the real gene to each role he played.' Sending all my love to his family and friends.
Star Trek actor George Takei posted: ""We have lost one of the true giants of the screen.
""Gene Hackman could play anyone, and you could feel a whole life behind it,"" he wrote.
""He could be everyone and no-one, a towering presence or an everyday Joe. That's how powerful an actor he was. He will be missed, but his work will live on forever.""
Slumdog Millionaire star Anil Kapoor also called Hackman a ""genius"" performer. ""A true legend whose legacy will live on,"" he wrote.
As well as his Oscar wins, Hackman also collected two Baftas, four Golden Globes and a Screen Actors Guild Award.
The Guardian's film critic Pete Bradshaw wrote that Hackman's death ""marks the end of one of the greatest periods of US cinema: the American new wave.""
""Hackman was the gold standard for this era, ever since Warren Beatty gave him his big break with the role of Buck Barrow in Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde (1967),"" said Bradshaw.
""He was the character actor who was really a star; in fact the star of every scene he was in – that tough, wised-up, intelligent but unhandsome face perpetually on the verge of coolly unconcerned derision, or creased in a heartbreakingly fatherly, pained smile.""
Adding: ""He wasn't gorgeous like [Robert] Redford or dangerously sexy like [Jack] Nicholson, or even puckish like [Dustin] Hoffman; Hackman was normal, but his normality was steroidally supercharged.""
The critic branded his performance ""as the reckless, racist cop"", 'Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle, in William Friedkin's 1971 film The French Connection as ""unmissable"".",0
Thailand deports dozens of Uyghurs to China,"At least 40 Uyghurs have been deported to China,Thai authorities have confirmed, despite warnings from rights groups they could face possible torture and even death.
The group is thought to have been flown back to China's Xinjiang region on Thursday, after being held for 10 years in a Bangkok detention centre.
China has been accused of committing crimes against humanity and possibly genocide against the Uyghur population and other mostly Muslim ethnic groups in the north-western region of Xinjiang. Beijing denies all of the allegations.
It is the first time Thailand has deported Uyghurs since 2015.
The deportation has been shrouded in secrecy after serious concerns were raised by the United States and United Nations.
Thai media reported that several trucks, some with windows blocked with sheets of black plastic, left Bangkok's main immigration detention centre in the early hours of Thursday morning.
Hours later, tracker Flightrader24 showed an unscheduled China Southern Airlines flight leaving Bangkok, eventually arriving in Xinjiang. It was not immediately clear how many people had been deported.
The Thai government later said it had decided to send the 40 Uyghurs back to China because it was not right that they had been held for more than a decade, but that no other third country had stepped forward offering to take them. That includes Turkey, which has given Uyghurs asylum in the past.
Eight Uyghurs remain in Thailand, including five who are serving jail terms for crimes they committed while in detention.
The government also said that Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra was given assurances that the Uyghurs would be looked after if returned to China during her recent visit to the country.
She did not initially confirm any deportations had taken place when asked by reporters on Thursday.
""In any country in the world actions must adhere to the principles of law, international processes, and human rights,"" Shinawatra said.
Beijing said that 40 Chinese illegal immigrants were repatriated from Thailand, but refused to confirm that the group were Uyghurs.
""The repatriation was carried out in accordance with the laws of China and Thailand, international law and international practice,"" the foreign ministry said.
Chinese state media said the group had been ""bewitched"" by criminal organisations and were stranded in Thailand after illegally leaving the country.
The returned group is made up of more than 300 Uyghurs who were detained at the Thai border in 2014 after fleeing repression in Xinjiang.
Many were sent to Turkey, while others were deported back to China in 2015 - prompting a storm of protest from governments and human rights groups.
""What is the Thai government doing?"" asked opposition lawmaker Kannavee Suebsang on social media on Thursday.
""There must not be Uyghur deportation to face persecution. They were jailed for 11 years. We violated their human rights for too long.""
The detention centre where the Uyghurs - who had been charged with no crime, apart from entering Thailand without a visa - were kept was known to be unsanitary and overcrowded. Five Uyghurs died in custody.
In a statement on Thursday, Human Rights Watch said the group now face a high risk of torture, enforced disappearance and long-term imprisonment.
""Thailand's transfer of Uyghur detainees to China constitutes a blatant violation of Thailand's obligations under domestic and international laws,"" said the organisation's Asia director, Elaine Pearson.
""Until yesterday [Wednesday], senior Thai officials had made multiple public assurances that these men would not be transferred, including to allies and UN officials.""
Phil Robertson, director of the Asia Human Rights and Labour Advocates (AHRLA) group, said that the deportations ""totally destroyed"" the ""charade"" that the current Thai government was different to the previous one ""when it comes to transnational repression and cooperating with authoritarian neighbours"".
Amnesty International described the deportations as ""unimaginably cruel"".
On Thursday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned Thailand for the deportation and urged ""all governments in countries where Uyghurs seek protection not to forcibly return ethnic Uyghurs to China.""
He accused China of having ""committed genocide and crimes against humanity targeting predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other members of ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang"" in a statement published online.
The UN said it ""deeply regrets"" the deportations, a phrase echoed by the EU.
Meanwhile, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK disagrees ""in the strongest terms"" with Thailand's decision.
There are about 12 million Uyghurs, mostly Muslim, living in Xinjiang, which is officially known as the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR).
The Uyghurs speak their own language, which is similar to Turkish, and see themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations. They make up less than half of the Xinjiang population.
Recent decades have seen a mass migration of Han Chinese (China's ethnic majority) into Xinjiang, allegedly orchestrated by the state to dilute the minority population there.
China has also been accused of targeting Muslim religious figures and banning religious practices in the region, as well as destroying mosques and tombs.

Succession-like feud engulfs one of Singapore's richest families,"A Succession-like feud has engulfed one of Singapore's richest families as property tycoon Kwek Leng Beng accused his son of plotting a boardroom takeover.
Mr Kwek says he has filed court papers accusing his son Sherman of trying to take control of their real estate firm City Developments Limited (CDL). Sherman Kwek has denied the allegation.
Kwek Leng Beng, who is CDL's executive chairman, is also seeking to fire his son, who is the chief executive.
CDL, Singapore's biggest listed property developer, has halted trading in its shares on the financial hub's stock exchange.
The feud has sparked comparisons with the HBO television series Succession, in which the fictional Roy family fight for control of the global media firm Waystar RoyCo.
""We intend to change the chief executive officer at the appropriate time,"" Kwek Leng Beng said in a statement.
""As a father, firing my son was certainly not an easy decision.""
But the octogenarian added: ""This is necessary to deal with this attempted coup at the board level and restore corporate integrity.""
If Sherman Kwek is removed as chief executive, his father said he plans to replace him on an interim basis with his cousin Kwek Eik Sheng.
The dispute centres on an email sent by CDL's corporate secretary nominating two additional independent directors on the night of 28 January, the eve of the Lunar New Year - which marks the start of a major holiday in Singapore.
The row has attracted public attention in a part of the world in which battles over family businesses are not uncommon and have been known to end up in court.
After Wednesday's court hearing, Kwek Leng Beng said the two new directors had agreed to not exercise any powers until further notice.
The company has said Sherman Kwek would remain in the role until the issue was resolved.
Sherman Kwek said he and the majority of CDL's board were disappointed by what he described as extreme actions taken by his father ""regarding this disagreement around the size and make-up of the CDL board.""
“To reiterate, this has never been about ousting our esteemed chairman. These steps to strengthen our board have purely been to ensure CDL has the highest standards of governance to which it has become known,"" he said in a statement to the BBC.
Kwek Leng Beng, along with his father and brother, took control of then-loss-making CDL in 1971. He became the firm's executive chairman after his father's death in 1995.

Inside the Taliban's surveillance network monitoring millions,"In a crowded control centre, surrounded by dozens of TV screens, the Taliban's police force proudly shows off its newly-acquired network of 90,000 CCTV cameras - used to watch over the day-to-day lives of millions of people.
""We monitor the entire city of Kabul from here,"" says Khalid Zadran, a spokesperson for the Taliban police chief, pointing to one of the screens.
The authorities say such surveillance will help fight crime, but critics fear it will be used to clamp down on dissent and to monitor the strict morality code enforced by the Islamist Taliban government under their interpretation of Sharia law.
The BBC are the first international journalists allowed to see the system in action.
Inside the control room, police officers sit in rows watching the live streams from thousands of cameras, keeping tabs on the lives of the six million people who live in Kabul.
From car licence plates to facial expressions, everything is monitored.
""In certain neighbourhoods, when we notice groups of people and suspect they might be involved in drug use, criminal activities, or something suspicious, we quickly reach out to the local police,"" says Zadran.
""They arrive swiftly to investigate the nature of the gathering.""
Under the previous government, Kabul was threatened daily with attacks from the Taliban and so-called Islamic State militants, as well as high profile kidnappings and car-jackings. When the Taliban retook power in 2021, they promised to crack down on crime.
The dramatic increase in the number of surveillance cameras in the capital is a sign of growing sophistication in the way the Taliban enforce law and order. Before their return, just 850 cameras were in place in the capital, according to a spokesman for the security forces that were driven from power.
However, in the past three years, the Taliban authorities have also introduced a range of draconian measures limiting people's rights and freedoms, especially those of women. The Taliban government has not been formally recognised by any other country.

The surveillance system the BBC is shown in Kabul features the option to track people by facial recognition. On the corner of one screen images pop up with each face categorised by age range, gender, and whether or not they have a beard or a face mask.
""On clear days, we can zoom in on individuals [who are] kilometres away,"" says Zadran, highlighting a camera positioned up high that focuses on a busy traffic junction.
The Taliban even monitor their own personnel. At a checkpoint, as soldiers popped open the trunk of a car for inspection, the operators focused their lenses, zooming in to scrutinise the contents within.
The interior ministry says the cameras have ""significantly contributed to enhancing safety, curbing crime rates, and swiftly apprehending offenders"". It adds the introduction of CCTV and motorcycle controls have led to a 30% decrease in crime rates between 2023 and 2024 but it is not possible to independently verify these figures.
However, rights groups are concerned about who is being monitored and for how long.
Amnesty International say installing cameras ""under the guise of 'national security' sets a template for the Taliban to continue their draconian policies that violate fundamental rights of people in Afghanistan - especially women in public spaces"".
By law women are not allowed to be heard outside their houses, although in practice this is not being strictly enforced. Teenage girls are prevented from accessing secondary and higher education. Women are barred from many forms of employment. In December, women training as midwives and nurses told the BBC they had been ordered not to return to classes.
While women continue to be visible on the streets of cities like Kabul, they are required to wear a face covering.
Fariba*, a young graduate who lives with her parents in Kabul, has been unable to find work since the Taliban came to power. She tells the BBC there is ""significant concern that surveillance cameras may be used to monitor women's hijabs [veils]"".
The Taliban say only the city police have access to the CCTV system and the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice Ministry – the Taliban's morality police - does not use it.
But Fariba is concerned the cameras will further endanger those opposed to Taliban rule.
""Many individuals, especially ex-military members, human rights advocates and protesting women, struggle to move freely and often live in secrecy,"" she says.
""There is significant concern that surveillance cameras will be used to monitor women's hijabs too,"" she says.
Human Rights Watch, meanwhile, says Afghanistan does not have the data protection laws in place to regulate how the collected CCTV footage is held and used.
The police say the data is kept only for three months, while, according to the interior ministry, the cameras do not pose a threat to privacy as they ""are operated from a special and completely confidential room by a specific and professional person in charge"".
The cameras appear to be Chinese-made. The control room monitors and branding on the feeds the BBC saw carried the name Dahua, a Chinese government-linked company. Earlier reports that the Taliban were in talks with China's Huawei Technologies to buy cameras were denied by the company. Taliban officials refused to answer BBC questions about where they sourced the equipment.
Some of the cost of installing the new network is falling on ordinary Afghans who are being monitored by the system.
In a house in central Kabul the BBC spoke to Shella*, who was asked to pay for some of the cameras installed on the streets near her home.
""They demanded thousands of afghanis from every household,"" she says. It's a large amount in a country where those women who have jobs may earn only around 5,000 afghanis ($68; £54) a month.

The humanitarian situation in Kabul, and in Afghanistan in general, remains precarious after years of war. The country's economy is in crisis, but international aid funding has been largely stopped since the Taliban came back to power.
According to the United Nations, 30 million people are in need of aid.
""If families refused to pay [for the cameras], they were threatened with water and power cuts within three days,"" Shella adds. ""We had to take loans to cover the costs.
""People are starving - what good are these cameras to them?""
The Taliban say that if people do not want to contribute, they can put in an official complaint.
""Participation was voluntary, and donations were in the hundreds, not thousands,"" Khalid Zadran, the Taliban police spokesperson, insists.
Despite the assurances, rights campaigners both inside and outside Afghanistan continue to have concerns over how such a powerful surveillance system will be used.
Jaber, a vegetable seller in Kabul, says the cameras represent another way in which Afghans are made to feel powerless.
""We are treated like trash, denied the opportunity to earn a living, and the authorities regard us as worthless,"" he told the BBC.
""We can do nothing.""

Thailand deports dozens of Uyghurs to China,"At least 40 Uyghurs have been deported to China,Thai authorities have confirmed, despite warnings from rights groups they could face possible torture and even death.
The group is thought to have been flown back to China's Xinjiang region on Thursday, after being held for 10 years in a Bangkok detention centre.
China has been accused of committing crimes against humanity and possibly genocide against the Uyghur population and other mostly Muslim ethnic groups in the north-western region of Xinjiang. Beijing denies all of the allegations.
It is the first time Thailand has deported Uyghurs since 2015.
The deportation has been shrouded in secrecy after serious concerns were raised by the United States and United Nations.
Thai media reported that several trucks, some with windows blocked with sheets of black plastic, left Bangkok's main immigration detention centre in the early hours of Thursday morning.
Hours later, tracker Flightrader24 showed an unscheduled China Southern Airlines flight leaving Bangkok, eventually arriving in Xinjiang. It was not immediately clear how many people had been deported.
The Thai government later said it had decided to send the 40 Uyghurs back to China because it was not right that they had been held for more than a decade, but that no other third country had stepped forward offering to take them. That includes Turkey, which has given Uyghurs asylum in the past.
Eight Uyghurs remain in Thailand, including five who are serving jail terms for crimes they committed while in detention.
The government also said that Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra was given assurances that the Uyghurs would be looked after if returned to China during her recent visit to the country.
She did not initially confirm any deportations had taken place when asked by reporters on Thursday.
""In any country in the world actions must adhere to the principles of law, international processes, and human rights,"" Shinawatra said.
Beijing said that 40 Chinese illegal immigrants were repatriated from Thailand, but refused to confirm that the group were Uyghurs.
""The repatriation was carried out in accordance with the laws of China and Thailand, international law and international practice,"" the foreign ministry said.
Chinese state media said the group had been ""bewitched"" by criminal organisations and were stranded in Thailand after illegally leaving the country.
The returned group is made up of more than 300 Uyghurs who were detained at the Thai border in 2014 after fleeing repression in Xinjiang.
Many were sent to Turkey, while others were deported back to China in 2015 - prompting a storm of protest from governments and human rights groups.
""What is the Thai government doing?"" asked opposition lawmaker Kannavee Suebsang on social media on Thursday.
""There must not be Uyghur deportation to face persecution. They were jailed for 11 years. We violated their human rights for too long.""
The detention centre where the Uyghurs - who had been charged with no crime, apart from entering Thailand without a visa - were kept was known to be unsanitary and overcrowded. Five Uyghurs died in custody.
In a statement on Thursday, Human Rights Watch said the group now face a high risk of torture, enforced disappearance and long-term imprisonment.
""Thailand's transfer of Uyghur detainees to China constitutes a blatant violation of Thailand's obligations under domestic and international laws,"" said the organisation's Asia director, Elaine Pearson.
""Until yesterday [Wednesday], senior Thai officials had made multiple public assurances that these men would not be transferred, including to allies and UN officials.""
Phil Robertson, director of the Asia Human Rights and Labour Advocates (AHRLA) group, said that the deportations ""totally destroyed"" the ""charade"" that the current Thai government was different to the previous one ""when it comes to transnational repression and cooperating with authoritarian neighbours"".
Amnesty International described the deportations as ""unimaginably cruel"".
On Thursday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned Thailand for the deportation and urged ""all governments in countries where Uyghurs seek protection not to forcibly return ethnic Uyghurs to China.""
He accused China of having ""committed genocide and crimes against humanity targeting predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other members of ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang"" in a statement published online.
The UN said it ""deeply regrets"" the deportations, a phrase echoed by the EU.
Meanwhile, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK disagrees ""in the strongest terms"" with Thailand's decision.
There are about 12 million Uyghurs, mostly Muslim, living in Xinjiang, which is officially known as the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR).
The Uyghurs speak their own language, which is similar to Turkish, and see themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations. They make up less than half of the Xinjiang population.
Recent decades have seen a mass migration of Han Chinese (China's ethnic majority) into Xinjiang, allegedly orchestrated by the state to dilute the minority population there.
China has also been accused of targeting Muslim religious figures and banning religious practices in the region, as well as destroying mosques and tombs.

Trump says US will impose additional 10% tariff on China,"Donald Trump said he planned to hit goods from China with a new 10% tariff, the latest salvo in the US president's steadily escalating trade fights.
Imports from China already face taxes at the border of at least 10%, after a Trump tariff order that went into effect earlier this month.
China's ministry of foreign affairs said it ""strongly"" expressed its ""dissatisfaction and resolute opposition"" to the plans.
Trump also said on Thursday he intended to move forward with threatened 25% tariffs on imports from Canada and Mexico, which are set to come into effect on 4 March.
Trump's comments came as officials from Mexico and Canada were in Washington for discussions aimed at heading off that plan.
Trump had announced the plans for 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada for 4 February unless the two nations increased border security.
He paused the measures for a month at the last minute after the two countries agreed to increase border funding and talk more about how to combat drug trafficking.
On social media on Thursday, Trump wrote that he did not think enough action had been taken to address the flow of fentanyl to the US.
""Drugs are still pouring into our Country from Mexico and Canada at very high and unacceptable levels,"" he wrote, adding that ""a large percentage"" of the drugs were made in China.
Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum, at a press conference from the country's National Palace, said in response: ""As we know, [Trump] has his way of communicating.""
She added: ""I hope we can reach an agreement and on 4 March we can announce something else.""
Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau also said his country was working hard to reach a deal, warning tariffs from the US would prompt an ""immediate and extremely strong response"".
Trump's threats against Mexico and Canada have raised widespread alarm, as the North American economy is closely connected after decades of operating under a free trade agreement.
Leaders of the two countries have previously said they would impose retaliatory tariffs on the United States if the White House went ahead with its plans.
Tariffs are a tax collected by the government and paid for by the business bringing the goods into the country.
China, Mexico and Canada are America's top three trade partners, together accounting for more than 40% of imports into the US last year.
Economists have warned tariffs on goods from the three countries could lead to higher prices in the US on everything from iPhones to avocados.
Trump's call for an additional 10% levy on goods from China - which he said would also go into effect on Tuesday - had not been previously announced, though during his presidential campaign he backed border taxes on Chinese products of as much as 60%.
A spokesperson for China's ministry of foreign affairs, Lin Jian, said that Trump was using the issue of the drug fentanyl entering the US from China as an ""excuse"" to threaten tariffs, adding it had one of the ""strictest"" drug control policies in the world.
""Pressure, coercion, and threats are not the correct way to deal with China,"" he said.
Liu Pengyu, spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy, had earlier said that his country was already working with the US to address the concerns about fentanyl, and had made ""visual progress"" in areas such as information exchange, case cooperation and online advertisement cleanup.
""Reducing domestic drug demand and strengthening law enforcement cooperation are the fundamental solutions,"" he said in a statement, which warned that Trump's tariff moves were ""bound to affect and undermine future counternarcotics cooperation between the two sides"".
""The unilateral tariffs imposed by the US will not solve its own problems, nor will it benefit the two sides or the world.""

Trump's comments, which called for drug flow to stop or be ""severely limited"", seemed to set the stage for Mexico and Canada to negotiate, said trade expert Christine McDaniel, a senior research fellow at the Mercatus Center at George Washington University.
On Thursday, as tariff talks intensified, two imprisoned alleged leaders of the violent Zetas cartel long sought by the US - Miguel Angel Trevino Morales and his brother Oscar - were extradited.
Mexican media said they were part of a larger group of drug lords sent from Mexico to the US - a major step in terms of US-Mexico security relations.
Ms McDaniel said Trump's demands of China were less clear, raising the likelihood that those measures will come into effect.
Trump's initial round of tariffs on China was eclipsed by his threats against Canada and Mexico. But the potential for further duties raises questions about how businesses will respond.
Ms McDaniel said she expected the hit to be felt more in China.
""It's not costless for the US, but so far it seems more costly for China,"" she said.
The impact of tariffs, if they go into effect, is expected to be felt more in the Canadian and Mexican economies, which count on the US as a key export market.
But analysts have warned that the threat of the levies, even if they are never imposed, is still likely to have a chilling effect on investment, including in the US.
China has already responded to the first round of tariffs from the US with its own tariffs on US products, including coal and agricultural machinery.
Trump has dismissed fears about damage to the American economy.",0
Tate brothers arrive in US after Romania prosecutors lift travel ban,"British-American influencers Andrew and Tristan Tate - who are facing trial in Romania on charges including human trafficking - have arrived in the US after Romanian prosecutors lifted a two-year travel ban.
Andrew, 38, and his brother Tristan, 36, have strongly denied the allegations against them. The two departed Bucharest on a private jet early on Thursday and arrived in Florida hours later, with Andrew telling reporters they are ""misunderstood"".
Romanian prosecutors stressed the case against them had not been dropped and that they remain ""under judicial control"" - meaning they have to regularly report to authorities and are expected to return to Romania.
However their exit has sparked concerns that prosecutors felt political pressure from the Trump administration. The US president said he knew nothing about the Tate brothers being released from Romania.
The Tate brothers are accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women in Romania. Andrew Tate is also accused of rape.
In the US they also face a civil case from a woman who alleges the brothers coerced her into sex work, and then defamed her after she gave evidence to Romanian authorities.
The brothers also face separate charges in the UK of rape and human trafficking. They deny all the allegations against them.
Upon arrival, Andrew Tate told reporters: ""We live in a democratic society where it's innocent until proven guilty and I think my brother and I are largely misunderstood.""
""There's a lot of opinions about us, a lot of things that got around about us on the internet,"" he said, adding that they are ""yet to be convicted of any crime in our lives ever"".
The brothers declined to answer questions about their release and Trump's role in them being allowed into the US.
A lawyer for the Tate brothers, Joseph McBride, said they will return to Romania at the end of March to meet the prosecutor before returning to the US.
""They feel secure in America for several reasons, the primary one being that Donald Trump is the president. As a result, they are excited to call America their home again,"" Mr McBride said in a statement.
Speaking in the White House after their plane landed, Trump said he knew nothing about the Tate brothers being released from Romania.
Asked if his administration pressured the Romanian government to release them, he said: ""I know nothing about that. I don't know, you're saying he's on a plane right now?""
UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who was sitting next to Trump in the White House, said: ""There's an English element here, so obviously it's important justice is done, and human trafficking is obviously, to my mind, a security risk.""
On Thursday, the brothers arrived at Fort Lauderdale in Florida around 11:00 local time (16:00 GMT) and were seen disembarking the aircraft.
Their arrival follows comments made by Trump administration figures earlier this month.
The Tates have regularly posted messages in support of Trump, and Tristan Tate has said his brother's role in persuading ""millions of young men"" to back him ""cannot be overlooked"".
Romania's Foreign Minister has also told Romanian TV that Trump's envoy for special missions had raised the brothers during a conversation at the Munich Security Conference in Germany a fortnight ago.
Emil Hurezeanu said his discussion with Richard Grenell had been informal and he did not consider the approach ""a form of pressure"". Grenell told the Financial Times his support for the brothers was evident from his ""publicly available tweets"".
However, women who have brought sexual abuse allegations against the Tate brothers said last week they were ""extremely concerned"" by reports that US officials had asked Romania to relax travel restrictions for the men.
Andrew Tate is a self-described misogynist who has attracted millions of followers online, despite being previously banned from social media platforms for expressing his views.
He and his brother were first arrested in Romania in December 2022, with Andrew accused of rape and human trafficking and Tristan suspected of human trafficking.
They both denied the charges and spent several months under house arrest. A year later, in August 2024, they faced new allegations including sex with a minor and trafficking underage persons, all of which they deny.
A former kickboxer who had appeared on UK TV show Big Brother, Andrew had moved from the UK to Romania several years ago. However police in Bedfordshire are still seeking his extradition on separate and unrelated allegations of rape and human trafficking, as well as tax evasion.
In the UK, four British women have filed a civil case against Andrew Tate in the UK High Court, alleging that he raped and coercively controlled them. Tate denies all the allegations against him.
Those plaintiffs said it was clear he would not face criminal prosecution in Romania and appealed to UK authorities to take action.
""We are in disbelief and feel re-traumatised by the news that the Romanian authorities have given into pressure from the Trump administration to allow Andrew Tate to travel around Europe and to the US,"" the women said in a statement.
Elena Lasconi, who is running for the Romanian presidency in May's elections, six months after they were controversially cancelled, has called for the immediate resignation of the head of Romania's organised crime investigations directorate DIICOT, which made the decision to let the brothers leave.
""I am outraged!"" she wrote on social media, ""as a woman, a human being and a Romanian."" Lasconi said prosecutors should explain publicly whether their decision had come as a result of external pressure.
Prosecutors from DIICOT have emphasised that the judicial conditions for the brothers have not changed.
Any violation of those obligations made in bad faith ""may lead to the replacement of judicial control with a higher measure of deprivation of liberty"", it said in a statement in Romanian.
Following a successful court appeal on Wednesday, the brothers also had multiple assets returned to them which had originally been seized by authorities - including six properties, six cars, and frozen bank accounts.
This comes after court limitations were ""modified in order to allow the brothers to travel to the USA,"" the statement from the Tates' representative said.
The Tates are understood to be required to return to Bucharest at the end of March to satisfy the prosecutors' terms, however it is too early to say whether they will comply with them.
Romania is both a member of the European Union and a key Nato member state on the Western alliance's eastern flank. It has an extradition treaty with the US.
Senior Trump figures have also had the government in Bucharest in their sights over the court ruling that annulled last December's presidential election. Romanian intelligence services said far-right candidate Calin Georgescu had been supported by a flurry of TikTok accounts engineered by Russia.
Georgescu was indicted on Wednesday for attempted ""incitement to acts against the constitutional order"". He has denied any wrongdoing and has previously called the election annulment a ""formalised coup d'etat"". Prosecutors are still investigating the allegations of election fraud.",0
BBC review finds 'serious flaws' over Gaza documentary,"The BBC has apologised and admitted ""serious flaws"" in the making of a documentary about children's lives in Gaza.
The documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, was pulled from iPlayer last week after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.
It said it has ""no plans to broadcast the programme again in its current form or return it to iPlayer"".
Hoyo Films, the production company that made the documentary for the BBC, said it felt it was ""important to hear from voices that haven't been represented onscreen throughout the war with dignity and respect"".
The company added it was ""cooperating fully"" with the BBC to ""help understand where mistakes have been made"".
The BBC removed the documentary after concerns were raised that it centred on a boy called Abdullah who is the son of Hamas's deputy minister of agriculture. Hamas is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UK and others.
It also launched a review into the film, and the BBC's Board met earlier on Thursday to discuss it.
In the statement, a BBC spokesperson said both the production company and the BBC had made ""unacceptable"" flaws and that it ""takes full responsibility for these and the impact that these have had on the corporation's reputation"".
It added the BBC had not been informed of the teenager's family connection in advance by the film's production company.
The spokesperson says: ""During the production process, the independent production company was asked in writing a number of times by the BBC about any potential connections he and his family might have with Hamas.
""Since transmission, they have acknowledged that they knew that the boy's father was a deputy agriculture minister in the Hamas government; they have also acknowledged that they never told the BBC this fact.
""It was then the BBC's own failing that we did not uncover that fact and the documentary was aired.""
Hoyo Films have told the corporation that they paid the young boy's mother ""a limited sum of money"" for narrating the film via his sister's bank account, the BBC statement added.
It said Hoyo assured the BBC that no payments were made to any members of Hamas or its affiliates ""either directly, in kind or as a gift"", and that it is seeking ""additional assurance"" around the programme's budget.
In its statement, Hoyo added: ""We feel this remains an important story to tell, and that our contributors – who have no say in the war – should have their voices heard"".
A full audit of the expenditure on the film will be undertaken by the BBC, and it will be asking for the relevant financial accounts of Hoyo Films so this can be carried out.
The BBC spokesperson said the incident had ""damaged"" the trust in the Corporation's journalism - and ""the processes and execution of this programme fell short of our expectations"".
They added the director-general of the BBC had asked for complaints to be expedited to the Executive Complaints Unit, ""which is separate from BBC News"".
A separate statement from the BBC Board added: ""The subject matter of the documentary was clearly a legitimate area to explore, but nothing is more important than trust and transparency in our journalism. While the Board appreciates that mistakes can be made, the mistakes here are significant and damaging to the BBC.""
Prime Minister Keir Starmer was asked about the film during a press conference with US President Donald Trump on Thursday, saying he had been ""concerned"" about it, adding that ""the secretary of state has had a meeting with the BBC"".
Earlier this week, the BBC was criticised for pulling the programme by more than 500 media figures, including Gary Lineker, Anita Rani and Riz Ahmed.",0

"UK-US trade deal could mean tariffs 'not necessary', says Trump","A trade deal between the US and UK could happen ""very quickly"", President Donald Trump said at a joint press conference with Sir Keir Starmer.
Speaking during the prime minister's visit to the White House, Trump envisaged ""a real trade deal"" which could see the UK avoid the kind of tariffs the president has been threatening on some of the US's other trading partners.
The trip had been seen as a key moment in Sir Keir's premiership as he sought to influence Trump's decisions on topics including Ukraine, as well as trade.
Sir Keir kicked off his White House visit by presenting Trump with a letter from King Charles inviting him to an ""unprecedented"" second state visit to the UK.
Receiving the letter in front of cameras in the Oval Office, Trump said it would be a ""great honour"" and described the King as ""a wonderful man"".
Sir Keir said the offer of a second state visit was ""truly historic"". Traditionally US presidents have only been given one state visit.
Having confirmed he would be accepting the invite, Trump, along with Sir Keir took questions from reporters for 30 minutes.
The US president did most of the talking, setting out his stance on many subjects including the possibility of a Ukraine deal and the UK's potential agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands.
On the plane to the US, Sir Keir reiterated his willingness to send British troops to Ukraine as part of a peace deal.
However, he argued that, without US security guarantees, Russian President Vladimir Putin could re-invade Ukraine.
Asked if he would provide such assurances, Trump said a minerals agreement he plans to sign with Ukraine on Friday could provide a ""backstop"".
He said ""nobody will play around"" if US workers were in the country, as part of the deal on minerals.
The US president was pressed on whether he stood by his accusation that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was a ""dictator"".
""Did I say that? I can't believe I said that,"" he said.
He later added he had ""a lot of respect"" for Zelensky, who he will host in Washington DC on Friday.
The UK's planned agreement with Mauritius over the Chagos Islands was one potential source of tension between the UK and US leaders.
However, Trump appeared to back the UK's approach saying he was ""inclined to go along with it"".
The deal would see the UK cede sovereignty of the Indian Ocean archipelago, but maintain control over the island of Diego Garcia, which includes a US-UK military airbase, by leasing it back.
After taking questions in the Oval Office, the two leaders took part in talks and then held a formal press conference, during which Trump repeatedly spoke about a possible US-UK trade deal which could be agreed ""very quickly"".
Referring to an economic, rather than a trade deal, Sir Keir said the UK and US would begin work on an agreement centred on the potential of artificial intelligence.
""Instead of over-regulating these new technologies, we're seizing the opportunities they offer,"" he said.
He said the UK and US had shaped the ""great technological innovations of the last century"" and now had the chance to do the same in the 21st Century.
""Artificial intelligence could cure cancer. That could be a moon shot for our age, and that's how we'll keep delivering for our people,"" he said.
Trump has repeatedly threatened to impose tariffs - import taxes - on many of its allies, including 25% on goods made in the European Union.
He also ordered a 25% import tax on all steel and aluminium entering the US - which could hit the UK.
Asked if Sir Keir had tried to dissuade the president from ordering tariffs against the UK, Trump said: ""He tried.""
""He was working hard I tell you that. He earned whatever the hell they pay him over there,"" he said.
""I think there's a very good chance that in the case of these two great, friendly countries, I think we could very well end up with a real trade deal where the tariffs wouldn't be necessary. We'll see.""
In a bid to convince the president against UK tariffs, Sir Keir said the US-UK trade relationship was ""fair, balanced and reciprocal"".
Since leaving the European Union, successive British leaders have hoped to get a general free trade deal with the US.
In his first term as president, Trump said talks about a ""very substantial"" trade deal with the UK were under way.
However, negotiations stalled with disagreements over US agricultural exports and UK taxes on tech companies causing problems.",0

Qatar Airways says crew handled dead passenger 'appropriately',"Qatar Airways says an internal review has found that its crew ""acted quickly, appropriately and professionally"" when they placed the body of a woman who died mid-flight next to an Australian couple.
The airline issued the statement to the BBC on Friday, after the couple told Australia's Channel Nine that they were traumatised by the experience on the Melbourne to Doha flight.
Qatar Airways had apologised in a previous statement for ""any inconvenience or distress this incident may have caused"".
The incident sparked debate over procedures on dealing with deaths aboard planes.
Mitchell Ring and Jennifer Colin, who were travelling to Venice for a holiday, said the cabin crew had placed the dead woman, covered in blankets, next to Mr Ring for the last four hours of a 14-hour flight.
The cabin crew had trouble moving her body through the aisle to the business class section because ""she was quite a large lady"", Mr Ring said.
They then asked Mr Ring to move over and placed the lady in the seat he was in.
While Ms Colin was invited by another passenger to sit beside her across the aisle, Mr Ring said the plane's staff did not offer to move him elsewhere even though there were vacant seats around.
Qatar Airways said on Friday that the crew's handling of the woman's death was ""in line with training and industry standard practice"".
""Passengers were accommodated to other seats, and a crew member was sitting at all times with the deceased passenger for the duration of the flight until landing in Doha,"" its statement said.
""It is an unfortunate reality that unexpected deaths do sometimes occur on board aircraft across the aviation industry and our crew are highly trained to deal with these situations with as much respect and dignity as possible.""
The airline also said that they have offered support and compensation to the family of the deceased and other passengers who were ""directly affected"" by the incident.
""We totally understand that we can't hold the airline responsible for the poor lady's death, but surely after that there has to be a protocol to look after the customers on board,"" Ms Colin said in the televised interview with Channel 9.
When the plane landed, Mr Ring said passengers were asked to stay put while medical staff and police came on board. Ambulance officers then started pulling blankets off the woman and he saw her face, he said.
""I can't believe they told us to stay,"" he said, adding that he thought they would have let the passengers leave before medical staff arrived.
Barry Eustance, a former Virgin Atlantic captain, earlier told the BBC that in his experience ""the crew would normally try to isolate the body, so there is no passenger exposure to the body and vice versa, for respect and privacy but also for medical reasons"".
According to the guidelines by the International Air Transport Association on dealing with deaths on board a flight, the deceased person should be moved to a seat, preferably one with few other passengers nearby, and covered with a blanket or body bag up to the neck. The body could also be moved to another area that does not obstruct an aisle or exit.
Upon landing, the association recommends that other passengers disembark before the body is attended to by local authorities.

Goldman Sachs pledges £1.5m to support apprentices,"Goldman Sachs has pledged £1.5m to a West Midlands apprenticeship fund to help businesses in the region to develop their staff.
The investment bank announced it would be committing funds from its apprenticeship levy to the West Midlands Combined Authority (WMCA) levy transfer scheme.
The money will help small and medium-sized businesses, charities and social enterprises to invest in and develop staff.
West Midlands Mayor Richard Parker said the WMCA's apprenticeship levy scheme had already raised £50m, funding 4,800 apprentices in the region.
Parker added more residents could get access to apprenticeships and smaller businesses could train workforces for the future following the boost in funding.
""Only by working together can we tackle one of the biggest problems faced by our region, unemployment, particularly among young people,"" he said.
""Goldman Sachs has already shown their dedication to the region with their offices in Birmingham, but now they are showing how they are supporting our residents too.""
The investment firm established its Birmingham office in 2021 and now has more than 450 employees in the city, moving to a permanent office at One Centenary Way last year.
Gurjit Jagpal, head of Goldman Sachs Birmingham, said they were proud to support the expansion of apprenticeships in the region.
""This reflects our ongoing commitment to Birmingham and our belief in the importance of digital and workplace skills,"" he said.
""The depth and quality of talent in the region has been a differentiator since we opened our Birmingham office,"" he said, ""and we look forward to continuing to engage positively with local communities to invest in talent across all levels of experience.""

Succession-like feud engulfs one of Singapore's richest families,"A Succession-like feud has engulfed one of Singapore's richest families as property tycoon Kwek Leng Beng accused his son of plotting a boardroom takeover.
Mr Kwek says he has filed court papers accusing his son Sherman of trying to take control of their real estate firm City Developments Limited (CDL). Sherman Kwek has denied the allegation.
Kwek Leng Beng, who is CDL's executive chairman, is also seeking to fire his son, who is the chief executive.
CDL, Singapore's biggest listed property developer, has halted trading in its shares on the financial hub's stock exchange.
The feud has sparked comparisons with the HBO television series Succession, in which the fictional Roy family fight for control of the global media firm Waystar RoyCo.
""We intend to change the chief executive officer at the appropriate time,"" Kwek Leng Beng said in a statement.
""As a father, firing my son was certainly not an easy decision.""
But the octogenarian added: ""This is necessary to deal with this attempted coup at the board level and restore corporate integrity.""
If Sherman Kwek is removed as chief executive, his father said he plans to replace him on an interim basis with his cousin Kwek Eik Sheng.
The dispute centres on an email sent by CDL's corporate secretary nominating two additional independent directors on the night of 28 January, the eve of the Lunar New Year - which marks the start of a major holiday in Singapore.
The row has attracted public attention in a part of the world in which battles over family businesses are not uncommon and have been known to end up in court.
After Wednesday's court hearing, Kwek Leng Beng said the two new directors had agreed to not exercise any powers until further notice.
The company has said Sherman Kwek would remain in the role until the issue was resolved.
Sherman Kwek said he and the majority of CDL's board were disappointed by what he described as extreme actions taken by his father ""regarding this disagreement around the size and make-up of the CDL board.""
“To reiterate, this has never been about ousting our esteemed chairman. These steps to strengthen our board have purely been to ensure CDL has the highest standards of governance to which it has become known,"" he said in a statement to the BBC.
Kwek Leng Beng, along with his father and brother, took control of then-loss-making CDL in 1971. He became the firm's executive chairman after his father's death in 1995.
It now has more than 160 hotel, residential and commercial properties around the world and forms part of a multi-billion dollar family empire.",0
Amazon joins quantum race with 'cat qubit' powered chip,"Amazon has become the third tech giant in as many months to announce a breakthrough in quantum computing - a technology that promises vast processing power but is beset by technical difficulties.
The firm has unveiled Ocelot a prototype chip built on ""cat qubit"" technology - an approach that derives its name from the famous ""Schrödinger's cat"" thought experiment.
The chip seeks to address one of the biggest stumbling blocks to the development of quantum computers - making them error free.
Amazon says, taken alongside other recent breakthroughs in the industry, its work means useful quantum computers are likely to be with us sooner than previously thought.
But how quickly these machines will be powerful enough to be practically useful for a range of commercial applications is a matter of debate among experts.
Oskar Painter of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Center for Quantum Computing at the California Institute of Technology, where the work was carried out, told the BBC that recent progress meant an ""aggressive date"" of a decade was now ""looking more and more realistic"".
""Five years ago I would have said maybe 20 or 30 years"", he said but added ""this timeline's come in quite a bit.""
Ultimately AWS, which provides cloud computing services, would like to offer quantum computing services to its customers, but Mr Painter also said he believed the advanced machines could eventually help optimise the vast global logistics of Amazon's retail business.
""You know, a company like Amazon, you make a one percent improvement in that and you're talking large dollars right? Quantum computers could enable you to do that more effectively, more real time - and that's the real value there,"" he explained.
Quantum computers solve problems by exploiting the strange properties of matter and energy at very small scales, as described by the science of quantum physics.
Quantum computers won't replace so-called ""classical"" computers, but promise to be able to solve problems even the most powerful modern computers cannot - yielding new discoveries such as better batteries and new medicines.
But that potential is being held up by the problem of errors.
Quantum computers are extremely sensitive to noise in their environment - vibrations, heat, electromagnetic interference from mobile phones and WIFI networks, or even cosmic rays and radiation from outer space can all cause them to make errors, which then need to be corrected.
Cat qubits are one attempt at solving this problem by engineering error resistance into the design of the qubits it uses.
Qubits are the fundamental elements of quantum computers, the equivalent of bits in the computers most of us use today.
Cat qubits are named in honour of Erwin Schrödinger, whose cat-in-a-box question in 1935 helped illuminate some of the thinking behind quantum theory.
Amazon believes the new chip, which has just five cat qubits out of a total of 14 key components, could reduce the costs of correcting quantum errors by up to 90%, compared to current approaches.
The technology of cat qubits isn't exclusive to Amazon, a French company named Alice & Bob carried out pioneering work on the tech and continues to evolve the technology.
Mazyar Mirrahimi director of research at the French national technology research institute, Inria said Ocelot was ""an important step forward towards hardware-efficient fault-tolerant quantum computation"".
Amazon believes the new chip offers a path to scaling up to more powerful machines with this type of error proofing built in, but researchers admit there are many challenges ahead.
Michael Cuthbert director of the UK's National Quantum Computing Centre welcomed the progress Amazon had made but told the BBC it remained to be seen the effect it would have on the speed with which the industry is able to develop really useful quantum computers:
""Error correction is a vital step necessary in the long-term development of quantum computing. It is the crucial step that turns quantum computing into a practical and commercial tool we can use to solve complex problems in chemistry, materials science, medicine, logistics and energy.""
""Part of the challenge is how to scale the revolutionary technology efficiently – mechanisms that enable error correction without huge overheads in chip size, energy consumption and systems complexity are really welcome.""
Amazon researchers have published their findings in a research paper in the scientific journal Nature
Amazon joins Microsoft and Google in announcing a new experimental chip. But is this flurry of announcements the result of clever research or clever PR? Or is it coincidence, the tech equivalent of the saying buses always come in threes?
Heather West follows the quantum computing industry as a research manager for the International Data Corporation and was briefed on the new chip by Amazon in advance of publication.
She describes Amazon's results as an ""advancement"" rather than a breakthrough.
All three recent announcements have focused on reducing errors, and she tells me the industry is ""pivoting"" from a focus on the number of qubits to a focus the ""ability to use these these systems at scale to solve real world life problems. And by doing so we need to be able to solve the error correction within the quantum systems"".
However Mr Painter agreed ""100%"" that it wouldn't be easy to scale up today's experimental systems.",0
Trump says 25% tariffs on EU will be announced soon,"US President Donald Trump has said he is planning to hit goods made in the European Union with tariffs of 25%, claiming the bloc was created to ""screw the United States"".
""We'll be announcing it very soon,"" he told reporters at an appearance with members of his cabinet. ""It'll be 25% generally speaking and that will be on cars and all other things.""
The European Union said it would react ""firmly and immediately against unjustified tariffs"".
Trump's appearance sparked questions about his trade plans, as he also appeared to raise the possibility that looming tariffs on imports from Mexico and Canada, set to come into force on 4 March, might be postponed again.
An administration official later said the deadline remained in place, with the president planning to review Mexico and Canada actions related to border security over the coming days.
Trump made clear on Wednesday that trade with Europe also remained in his sights, repeating his criticism of European policies, which he said put American exporters of food products and cars at a disadvantage.
""The European Union was formed to screw the United States - that's the purpose of it and they've done a good job of it,"" he said. ""But now I'm president.""
The EU rejected the president's claims, saying the creation of a regional market had made doing business in Europe easier for American firms.
""It has been a boon for the United States,"" a spokesperson for the commission said. ""We're ready to partner if you play by the rules. But we will also protect our consumers and businesses at every turn. They expect no less from us.""
Tariffs are a tax on imports that is collected by the government and paid for by the companies bringing in the goods.
Trump has vowed to use the levies to boost US manufacturing, raise money and push other countries to change policies he opposes.
But there are concerns such measures could fuel inflation, with warnings that Americans could face higher prices for goods as businesses may choose to pass on some or all of the cost of tariffs to customers.
Since taking office, he has raised tariffs of 10% on goods from China and taken steps to hit other imports with duties, including directing his staff to develop recommendations for custom ""reciprocal"" tariffs for each country.
But he has also suspended some of those plans, leaving many businesses and analysts guessing as to whether he is prepared to carry out his threats.
""The 25% threat that he threw out today is in line with the high end of the range that he previously indicated,"" said Tobin Marcus, head of US policy and politics at Wolfe Research.
""It's a number that's concerning - certainly should be concerning - for the trans-Atlantic trade relationship, but not totally out of the blue.""
Antonin Finkelnburg, of the Federation of German Wholesale, Foreign Trade and Services which represents businesses, told the BBC that a 25% tariff on EU goods entering the US would created a ""difficult"" but ""not an impossible"" situation for Germany's economy.
""We are worried but we shouldn't be afraid,"" he told the BBC's Today programme.
Germany's car industry's products are popular in the US.
Mr Finkelnburg said many German car manufacturers were ""already producing in the American market, so they wouldn't be directly affected by the tariffs"", but said tariffs would still drive up prices.
""The car parts that are manufactured in to those cars are crossing the borders of Mexico and Canada several times so that already is driving the prices up,"" he added.
Earlier this month, Trump ordered 25% tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada, America's top two trading partners. But he suspended the duties before they went into effect until 4 March, to allow for talks on border security.
On Monday, Trump said he expected tariffs of 25% on goods from Mexico and Canada to come into effect ""on schedule"".
At Wednesday's meeting, when asked for an update, he said the 25% tariffs on Mexico and Canada would go into effect on 2 April.
That is the same day that the Commerce Department is supposed to deliver its wider recommendations for ""reciprocal"" tariffs.
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told reporters that ""the overall is April 2"" , distinguishing between tariffs tied to concerns about drug trafficking and migration from Mexico and Canada.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq all headed lower in mid-day trade, while the peso and Canadian dollar gained.",0
Cook Islands China deal riles allies as West's grip loosens,"The Cook Islands may be small but the ambitions of its leader are mighty.
A range of deals Prime Minister Mark Brown signed with China without consulting the public or New Zealand – an ally to which the Cooks is closely tied – has caused increasing irritation and concern.
The agreements are the first of their kind with a country that is not a traditional ally. They cover infrastructure, ship-building, tourism, agriculture, technology, education and, perhaps crucially, deep-sea mineral exploration.
Brown says his decisions will be based on the ""long-term interests"" of the Cook Islands, which are remote, resource-rich and vulnerable to climate change.
Not everyone agrees with him. The new, wide-ranging deals with Beijing have led to protests on Rarotonga - the largest Cook Island - and a vote of no confidence against Brown in parliament, which he survived earlier this week. They have also worried Australia, another powerful ally.
New Zealand said it was ""blindsided"" by the China deals, but Brown believes his country is independent and does not need to consult Wellington on issues he says are of no concern to them.
He has, nevertheless, tried to reassure Australia and New Zealand that the deals with China don't replace their relationships. But the apparent snub comes at a time when the West's grip on the Pacific seems to be loosening.
The rise of China in the Pacific isn't new. Whether it's bagging a security deal in the Solomon Islands or providing medical services in Tonga, China's presence in the region has been growing. And the US and its allies have made a consistent effort to counter that.
But now there is a new dynamic at play as the Trump administration upends relationships with allies such as Ukraine and appears increasingly unpredictable.
The Cook Islands has had what's known as a ""free association"" relationship with New Zealand, a former coloniser, since the 1960s - meaning Wellington helps on issues like defence and foreign affairs, and that Cook Islanders hold New Zealand citizenship.
The two countries are very close. There are around 15,000 Cook Islanders living in the Pacific island nation, but as many as 100,000 live in New Zealand and Australia. Culturally, Cook Island Māori - who make up the majority of the population - are also closely related to, but distinct from, New Zealand Māori.
The deals with China aren't the only sign that Brown wants to pull away from New Zealand which have caused concern. He recently abandoned a proposal to introduce a Cook Islands passport following a public outcry.
""[The relationship with NZ] connects us politically and connects us to our brothers and sisters of Aotearoa [the Māori word for New Zealand] – they left our shores to sail to Aotearoa. We need to remember that,"" said Cook Islander Jackie Tuara at a recent demonstration against Brown's deals with China.
In a nation that is not used to huge displays of protest, several hundred people gathered outside parliament in Rarotonga, holding up placards that read: ""Stay connected with NZ"". Others waved their New Zealand passports.
""Let us stand in partnership with countries that have the same democratic principles as we are a democratic nation, are we not?"" Ms Tuara said. ""We don't want to see our land and our oceans sold to the highest bidder. Those resources are for us – for our children, for their future.""
But for all those who are opposed to Brown's recent moves away from New Zealand, there are plenty of Cook Islanders who back him.
China specialist Philipp Ivanov, in apparent agreement with the prime minister, says that ""the Pacific island nations have their own agency, their own motivations and their own capabilities"".
He believes that the recent developments in the Cook Islands are ""all part of that little great game that's going on between Australia and China and New Zealand in the Pacific. It's a whack-a-mole kind of game.""
While the US has long been a dominant force in security and military in the region, China has tried to strengthen its ties with the small but strategic Pacific Island nations through aid, infrastructure and security deals.
In response, the likes of the US and the UK have beefed up their diplomatic presence across the region. Australia too has made it clear it will redouble its support. But it's unclear to what extent US President Donald Trump will continue his predecessor's commitments in the region to counter China - and Beijing is taking advantage of that.
Last week, planes flying between New Zealand and Australia were diverted after China conducted military exercises involving live fire. Both Australia and New Zealand had been trailing the three Chinese warships that were making their way down the eastern coast of Australia in what experts say is an escalation and unexpected show of power.
""It's a pretty efficient way of testing the diplomatic response in both the Australia-China and New Zealand-China bilateral relationship, and what the US is prepared to say in defence [of its allies],"" says defence analyst Euan Graham, from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.
""It's also making the point that in the numbers game, China will always be ahead of smaller countries with smaller navies and Australia's navy is at a historic low.""
China's ambassador to Australia, Xiao Qian, told national broadcaster ABC that Beijing's actions had been appropriate and he won't apologise for it.
Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has been keen to emphasise that no international laws were broken and that the drills were carried out in international waters. Indeed, many have pointed out that Australia and its allies often sail warships through the South China Sea.
""I'd see it as China wanting to capitalise on the chaotic effect that Trump is having right now,"" says Mihai Sora, director of the Pacific Islands programme at Australia's Lowy Institute. ""China is taking advantage of that moment to [say], look Australia, you are actually alone. Where is the United States in all of this?""
Australia's Foreign Minister Penny Wong freely admits ""we are in a permanent state of contest in our region, that is the reality"".
In speaking out about the warships last week, Australia's government was trying to reassure the public about China's intentions, while also wanting to tell Australians that it's all in hand. That is not a coincidence as Australia heads towards a federal election in the coming months.
""[Opposition leader Peter] Dutton comes from this national security and home affairs background, so the government doesn't want to give him any air to criticise Labor,"" Philipp Ivanov says. ""Being weak on China would be disastrous for them, given what's going on in the US and given our own elections.""
But it also brings into focus the dilemma this part of the world faces.
""Canberra will be contesting every single move that Beijing tries to make … and it reflects the fact that Canberra and Beijing have diverging strategic interests,"" says James Laurenceson, the director of Australia-China Relations Institute at the University of Technology Sydney.
But, he adds, they also have ""enormous commonalities"" - China is Australia's largest trading partner - and New Zealand's - for instance.
""So you've got to be able to ride both these horses at the same time.""
It's not an easy relationship - it never has been. The bigger surprise is that of the US, a traditional ally.
Although many in the Trump administration still describe China as a grave threat, US allies are unsure what to expect from the Washington-Beijing relationship.
And now, as Trump threatens steel and aluminium tariffs and a withdrawal of foreign assistance, Australia feels more isolated than ever. The recent activity of China's warships in the Tasman Sea serves to highlight that isolation.
""I wouldn't think of them as military acts, so much as political acts using military hardware,"" says Mr Sora of the Lowy Institute.
""I think the political act is to say, look, we can do this anytime we want. You can't do anything about it, and the United States is not doing anything about it, because they're busy tearing down the global system.""",0
"BP shareholders want it to make money, not climate policy","It was more than 20 years ago that the then boss of BP reframed those famous initials as ""Beyond Petroleum"".
It was the first tentative step in transforming the company from an oil and gas producer to an energy provider investing an increasing amount of its fossil fuel profits into greener technology.
Five years ago, chief executive Bernard Looney, who was in charge at the time, accelerated that process with ambitious targets to cut oil and gas production 40% by 2030, while massively ramping up investment in wind and solar.
Today, BP could stand for ""Back to Petroleum"" following its announcement to shift back to oil and gas production and slash investment in renewables.
Why?
Profit and share price. There is simply less money in renewables than in oil and gas and some BP shareholders have become angry and impatient as they watch Shell produce double the returns they have seen while Exxon investors have received four times as much.
For most - but not all - shareholders, the number one job of a company's board and management is to maximise the value of the company.
BP's failure to do this has led to active speculation that BP should be taken over by a company that understands this. Or one that list its shares in the US where investors are less interested in a green transition.
Not all shareholders agree with BP's radical strategy shift back to petroleum. Dozens of them signed a letter expressing concern about increasing fossil fuel production and want to have a say in the company's direction of travel.
BP's move follows rivals' Shell and Norwegian company Equinor scaling back of plans to invest in green energy. Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump's ""drill baby drill"" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels.
Many groups say that long term BP and others are pursuing a no-win strategy.
Climate concerns will become so acute that much of the oil and gas they're searching for will have to remain in the ground and become unusable ""stranded assets"" of no commercial value.
However, the least patient shareholders tend to have the loudest voices.
As such, the cries of dismay from those concerned about the climate are being drowned out by those demanding that BP does what it knows best: drilling for oil and gas and returning those profits to shareholders, who include millions of pension savers.
They would say it is not BP's job to question how much oil and gas the world wants or needs - that is the job for the societies it serves and their policy makers.
And, while the UK government has decided it wants no new oil and exploration in UK waters, over 90% of BP's activities are outside the UK and the current US government thinks very differently.",0
Instagram may launch separate Reels app to take on TikTok - report,"Instagram is reportedly considering launching its short-form video feature, Reels, as a separate app as the future of Chinese-owned TikTok remains uncertain in the US.
The social media platform's boss Adam Mosseri told staff about the potential move this week, according to technology industry–focused business publication The Information, which cited a person who heard the remarks.
Instagram's parent company Meta did not immediately respond to a BBC request for comment.
In January, US President Donald Trump granted TikTok a 75-day extension to comply with a law signed by then-President Joe Biden that requires a sale or ban of the platform.
At the time, he floated the possibility of a joint venture running the company, saying he was seeking a 50-50 partnership between ""the United States"" and its Chinese owner ByteDance. But he did not give any further details on how that might work.
The Biden administration had argued that TikTok, which has 170 million US users, could be used by China as a tool for spying and political manipulation.
Opponents of a ban have cited freedom of speech as a reason for keeping the platform open.
In 2018, Meta launched a standalone app called Lasso to compete with TikTok but it was later shut down.",0
Trump administration unveils bird flu plan as egg prices soar,"The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has announced a $1bn (£792m) plan to help US farmers combat a raging bird flu epidemic that has required them to kill millions of chickens and pushed the cost of eggs to an all-time high.
Officials said they will budget $500m for biosecurity measures, roughly $100m for vaccine research and development, and $400m for farmer financial relief programs.
More than 35 million birds have been killed in response to bird flu outbreaks in commercial flocks this year, according to USDA data.
The bird culling has caused the average price for a dozen eggs in the US to hit $5 in January, a 53% increase from 2024 - and the USDA said prices could rise an additional 41%.
The Trump administration said it will provide commercial egg farms with best practices and consulting services for free, and pay up to 75% of the costs to address vulnerabilities to help prevent the spread of bird flu.
To address the threat of an egg shortage for US consumers, the government said it was willing to consider temporarily importing eggs that meet US safety standards.
The USDA also said it will eliminate regulations that they say raise the cost of eggs.
The policy changes are not expected to have an immediate affect on egg prices, USDA secretary Brooke Rollins told the BBC's media partner CBS News.
""This is more of a long-term solution, but what I can say is that those prices should start coming down maybe this spring, this summer as we work to implement some of those bigger-picture solutions,"" Rollins said.
Soaring egg prices in the US have had some surprising knock on effects.
In New York City, where a dozen eggs can fetch $14, some stores have reportedly started successfully selling single eggs - called ""loosies"" - to those unwilling to shell out for a full dozen.
In February, thieves in Pennsylvania stole over 100,000 eggs worth $40,000 from the back of a lorry.",0
Nvidia says AI chip sales strong despite DeepSeek fears,"Nvidia, the chip giant at the heart of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, said its business remained strong, despite fears of a bubble stirred by the emergence of Chinese AI firm DeepSeek last month.
Sales of the firm's chips hit more than $39bn (£30.7bn) over the three months ended 27 January, up 74% year-on-year.
Nvidia has seen a surge of demand, as big tech companies turn to the firm for chips that can handle the large amounts of data used to train AI models.
But DeepSeek said it had trained its chatbot using less advanced, and less expensive chips.
Its launch prompted a sharp sell-off in Nvidia shares earlier this month, a hit felt throughout the market.
Investors calmed after big companies such as Facebook owner Meta said they expected to continue their current AI investment strategies.
Nvidia boss Jensen Huang said he was not worried that demand would suddenly shift, saying that software in the future would be created by machine learning that needs chips with different architecture than the ""hand-coding"" of the past.
""We know fundamentally software has changed,"" he said, adding that it was also still ""early days"" for the use of AI to spread.
Nvidia currently dominates the market in advanced chips, making it central to the boom in AI investment at companies such as Microsoft.
Its shares have surged more than 400% over the last two years, giving the company a market value of more than $3tn.
Nvidia said it was focused on rapidly building out production of its latest chips, known as Blackwell, which helped to drive a surge in the firm's revenue.
The company's finance chief Collette Kress said its AI data centre business was strongest in the US, but the firm was also seeing demand grow in other parts of the world, pointing to investments by France and the European Union.
She said demand in China - where US trade controls have blocked the firm from exporting certain chips - remained lower and that the firm expected shipments to remain roughly at the current level.",0
Bezos focuses Washington Post opinion section on free markets and liberties,"Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos has announced that the newspaper's opinion section will focus on supporting “personal liberties and free markets"", and pieces opposing those views will not be published.
The move, which marks a major shift away from the section's broad opinion coverage, prompted the outlet's opinion editor David Shipley to resign.
Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, sent a memo to staff on Wednesday which he also posted to X.
“We are going to be writing every day in support and defence of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets,“ Bezos said.
He added the opinion section would cover other topics, but “viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others”.
“There was a time when a newspaper, especially one that was a local monopoly, might have seen it as a service to bring to the reader's doorstep every morning a broad-based opinion section that sought to cover all views,” Bezos wrote. “Today, the internet does that job.”
Bezos added that he had asked Mr Shipley if he wanted to stay at the outlet after the changes, but he said no.
""This is a significant shift, it won't be easy, and it will require 100% commitment - I respect his decision,"" Bezos said.
The billionaire businessman's move is a significant intervention in the editorial side of the newspaper, which he acquired in 2013.
It follows a decision last year not to run an endorsement of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, and to stop making presidential endorsements in general, which led to resignations and the loss of thousands of subscribers.
According to the Washington Post, Will Lewis, the outlet’s chief executive, said in a memo to staff that the changes to the opinion section were ""not about siding with any political party”.
""This is about being crystal clear about what we stand for as a newspaper,"" he said.
The decision was praised by several of President Donald Trump‘s allies, including billionaire Elon Musk, who wrote on social media: “Bravo, @JeffBezos!""
But on a Washington Post article announcing the change, some subscribers wrote in the comment section criticising the decision, and others said they would be cancelling their subscription.",0
Trump says $5m 'gold card' immigration visas will 'sell like crazy',"President Donald Trump has unveiled plans for selling a ""gold card"" visa for $5m (£3.9m) that will offer wealthy buyers permanent residency in the US and a path to citizenship.
At the first cabinet meeting of his current term, Trump told reporters that the visas would function similarly to green cards, which allow immigrants of varying incomes to live and work permanently in the US, but would go to ""high-level people"".
""The people that can pay $5m, they're going to create jobs,"" Trump said. ""It's going to sell like crazy. It's a bargain.""
Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, also at the meeting, said the gold visas would replace the current visa programme for foreign investors, but offered few details.
Dozens of countries around the world offer some sort of citizenship by investment programme, including several in Europe, like Portugal, which gives ""golden visas"", or permanent residency for foreigners who invest €500,000 ($524,000) into a qualifying fund.
Trump said companies would use the golden visa programme to hire non-citizens to work for them in the US.
""We have to be able to get people in the country, and we want people that are productive people,"" Trump said.
Typically, green card holders in the US can apply for citizenship after five years.
Trump suggested revenue from the high-priced visas could be used to pay off US debt.
Lutnick said that the initiative will replace the EB-5 visa, which gives permanent residency to some foreigners who invest around $1m and create at least 10 full-time jobs in the US.
Saying the EB-5 programme was ""poorly overseen and poorly executed"", Lutnick said the golden visas would be an improvement.
""We're going to make sure they're wonderful world-class global citizens,"" Lutnick said of future gold card applicants.
It was not immediately clear how the government would select recipients, if there were exclusions, or if there would be any cap on how many are issued.

US Supreme Court hears arguments in 'straight discrimination' case,"US Supreme Court justices indicated during a hearing on Wednesday that they would side with a woman who alleged she was discriminated against at her job because she is heterosexual.
Marlean Ames worked for the Ohio Department of Youth Services for more than 20 years.
She claims she was passed over for a promotion, then demoted, because she is straight. The job she hoped to get and the one she held when demoted, were both given to gay colleagues, according to the lawsuit.
Ohio state officials have denied the discrimination, and Ms Ames has so far been unsuccessful in court.
In oral arguments in front of the Supreme Court - split 6-3 in favour of conservative judges - justices on both sides ideologically appeared sympathetic to Ms Ames's case.
A 1964 US law forbids discrimination in the workplace, and in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that protection extends to sexual orientation, however lower courts have dismissed Ms Ames's case.
US court precedent covering some states, including Ohio, requires that members of majority groups - such as white people or heterosexuals - show a higher level of evidence when making discrimination claims.
Plaintiffs in those cases – sometimes called ""reverse discrimination"" – are required to show additional ""background circumstances"" to prove their case, for instance evidence that LGBTQ people made decisions affecting the person discriminated against, or evidence showing a pattern of discrimination.
According to the lawsuit, Ms Ames had positive performance evaluations, but in 2019 she and two other heterosexual employees were passed over for a promotion that was eventually given to a lesbian.
She was later demoted, according to the lawsuit, and her job was given to a gay man.
In addition to ruling that Ms Ames did not show a pattern of discrimination or ""background circumstances"", a lower court also previously found that managers at the youth services department had ""legitimate, nondiscriminatory business reasons"" for their decisions.
During arguments on Wednesday, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, one of the court's conservative members, said: ""Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, whether you are gay or straight, is prohibited. The rules are the same whichever way it goes.""
According to the transcript of the hearing, another conservative justice, Amy Coney Barrett, said that ""it doesn't matter if she was gay or whether she was straight"", the legal burden should be the same.
And several of the court's liberal justices seemed to agree. Neil Gorsuch indicated that he thought allowing Ms Ames' lawsuit to proceed would be a ""wise course"".
While talking about the facts of the case, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said ""something's suspicious"" which ""certainly can give rise to an inference of discrimination.""
Ohio officials were represented in court by the state Solicitor General T Elliot Gaiser, a former lawyer for Trump.
Gaiser told the justices ""everyone here agrees that everyone should be treated equally"", but argued that the officials who made the job decisions did not know Ames' sexual orientation and thus could not have used it to discriminate against her.
Lawyers for the state also argue that those making the employment decisions were heterosexual and had legitimate concerns about Ms Ames's vision for the youth services department.
The Supreme Court could order lower courts to re-examine the case and allow the lawsuit to go ahead.",0
Pokémon boss believes series can last another 50 to 100 years,"The boss of The Pokémon Company believes the series can last for at least another 50 years if it continues to innovate.
First launched on Nintendo's Game Boy in 1996, the video game has expanded into films, TV and toys to become one of the world's highest-grossing media franchise.
Most recently, the trading card game based on the cute creatures at the centre of its universe has seen a surge in popularity - but it has also brought scalpers and frauds to the hobby.
CEO Tsunekazu Ishihara, who has been in charge of the company since 1998, spoke to BBC News ahead of its yearly update about the secret of its success, tackling challenges, and the series' future.
Pokémon Day is an annual livestream showcasing upcoming releases, upgrades and events.
Fans got an extended look at upcoming Nintendo Switch title Pokémon Legends: Z-A, and learned it would be released later this year.
There was also a first glimpse of Pokémon Champions - an upcoming mobile game that appeared to be inspired by the Stadium series focused on battles.
And the company also showed off additions to the digital and physical versions of its trading card game.
Mr Ishihara wasn't giving away too much ahead of the event but says the company's long-term goal is to ""enrich both the real world and the virtual world"".
Pokémon GO - the company's successful mobile phone app that works with a device's GPS to place monsters in the real world - is an example of this.
""This is what I think is the biggest strength of Pokémon, and it's important for us to come up with this kind of idea,"" he says.
""So that's how I think of what we want to achieve next.""
One of the hottest topics among long-term Pokémon fans today is scalpers.
The resurgence of the collectible card game has caught the attention of resellers who buy up new packs in the hope of landing rare, valuable cards.
YouTuber Logan Paul switched a lot of people on to the potential profits of the hobby when he paid $5.3m (£3.9m) for the most expensive Pokémon card ever.
Gaming companies have long had an issue with the second-hand market, and Mr Ishihara says it ""prevents new products from being sold"".
""When the second hand market becomes more valuable because of rarity, that is problematic because our business is affected.""
Fans have suggested The Pokémon Company could produce a greater volume of hard-to-find or limited-run items but Mr Ishihara says it cannot do much to control the resale market.
""Those items are seen to be valuable because they're rare or seen as vintage – and it's not our place to say that they're not,"" he says.
On the topic of counterfeit products Mr Ishihara is more direct, and says the company's legal teams have fought ""rigorously"" against clones and fakes since the beginning.
It recently won a long legal battle against the Chinese company behind a copycat mobile app.
And earlier this year it joined Nintendo to sue the makers of Palworld - an online multiplayer survival game described as ""Pokémon with guns"".
It alleges developer Pocketpair infringed patents, which it has denied.
Pokémon has continued to bring new fans to the franchise by expanding into anime, card games, movies and toys alongside its video game titles.
Mr Ishihara says fans now ""span several generations"" and believes ""the biggest reason behind their success is the fact that Pokémon became a tool of communication"".
Last weekend, about 13,000 Pokémon fans headed to the European leg of the International Championships at London's Excel Centre.
It demonstrates Mr Ishihara's point that people have found their way into the series through various means.
Fans Justin, 25, and Marina, 28, who turned up to the event in Team Rocket costumes, tell BBC News they got into Pokémon by watching the animated TV show as children.
""I just loved all the designs, all the different characters,"" says Justin.
""They were just really really cute.""
Marina says in-person events have become a chance for her to meet fellow fans.
""I always used to want to go to conventions and these sorts of events.
""So being able to be here and network and make friends has been such a blessing,"" she says.
The Pokémon Company is unusual because it is a private company.
Other well-known Japanese brands, such as Nintendo and Hello Kitty maker Sanrio, are publicly traded and answerable to shareholders.
Mr Ishihara believes this allows his company to keep a single-minded focus on one thing.
""Pokémon is the only thing we do at the Pokémon Company,"" he says.
""So whatever profit we make from Pokémon gets reinvested in Pokémon.""
He adds that this means the company doesn't have to field questions about expanding or creating new characters from shareholders.
""Our answer will be: 'We'll go bust when Pokémon is no longer popular'.
""I don't think they will like that.""
At the end of 2023, longtime hero Ash Ketchum and his best pal Pikachu bowed out of the animated Pokémon series.
The series has continued without the well-loved duo, but one of the ""hardest questions"" Mr Ishihara gets asked is what they're up to now.
""Even though the TV camera may not be following them, Ash's journey is continuing and his partner Pikachu is right next to him.""
With the franchise set to mark its 30th anniversary next year, rumours are already beginning to swirl about special plans for the occasion.
Remakes or re-releases of the original Game Boy games are high on many fans' wishlists.
Mr Ishihara doesn't have much to say on that at the moment, but wants to maintain a focus on ""connecting the real and virtual worlds"".
""If we continue focusing on our mission, Pokémon can probably continue to its 50th or 100th anniversary,"" he says.
""But if we become complacent and go with the flow, that's when Pokémon will go downhill.""

Zelensky to meet Trump in Washington to sign minerals deal,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet US President Donald Trump in Washington on Friday to sign an agreement on sharing his country's mineral resources, Trump has said.
Zelensky has described the bilateral deal as preliminary, and said he wants further agreements which include US security guarantees to deter renewed Russian aggression.
But Trump said the US would not provide guarantees ""beyond... very much"", saying the responsibility should instead fall to Europe.
Trump also seemingly ruled out the prospect of Ukraine becoming a Nato member - one of Zelensky's long-held ambitions.
Speaking at a meeting of his cabinet on Wednesday, Trump said the presence of American workers extracting rare earth metals on Ukrainian soil would provide ""automatic security"" for Ukraine.
He said Kyiv should ""forget about"" joining Nato and repeated Russia's claims that the issue was one of the driving factors behind the war.
The US president suggested a ceasefire between Ukraine and Russia was not far off, telling reporters: ""We're going to make a deal with Russia and Ukraine to stop killing people.""
But Zelensky said without security guarantees ""we won't have a ceasefire, nothing will work, nothing"".
""I want to find a Nato path or something similar,"" he said.

Russia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine becoming a member, fearing it would bring Nato forces too close to its borders.
In 2008, the alliance had said that Ukraine could eventually join.
Trump has suggested European peacekeeping troops could be stationed in Ukraine as part of a ceasefire deal, but Russia says it is against this.
European representatives, however, were not included in Washington's initial talks with Russia.
Speaking to the BBC on Wednesday, Kaja Kallas, the EU High Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, said ""for any kind of deal to work on European soil, you need the Europeans to also agree to it"".
She said the mineral resources deal was up to Ukraine, but any peace agreement would ""need the Europeans on board"".
Ms Kallas' scheduled meeting with Secretary of State Marco Rubio on Wednesday was abruptly cancelled, with both sides citing scheduling issues.
Zelensky said the success of the minerals deal, which was formally backed by his government on Wednesday evening, would depend on the outcome of his meeting with Trump this week.
Key details have not yet been made public, but Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said it envisages an ""investment fund"" for Ukraine's reconstruction.
The prospect of a deal was first proposed by Zelensky last year as a way to offer the US a tangible reason to continue supporting Ukraine.
But disagreements over its substance exacerbated tensions between Trump and Zelensky in recent weeks.
The Ukrainian president had rejected an initial request from the US for $500bn (£395bn) in mineral wealth, but media reports suggest this demand has now been dropped.
There are also differences in how both sides are now describing the deal. Trump has lauded the ""very big agreement"" as an opportunity for the US to get its ""money back"" after funding aid to Ukraine.
But Zelensky has instead referred to it as a ""framework agreement"" upon which he hopes further deals can be made.
Trump has said he wants a quick end to the war in Ukraine and has sought to reset relations with Russia. After a phone call with Russian President Vladimir Putin, the two leaders sent delegations to Saudi Arabia in bilateral talks which excluded Ukraine.
In response, Zelensky accused the US of helping Putin ""break out of years of isolation"" and Trump of living in a ""Russian disinformation space"".
Ukraine is a country rich in natural resources. Kyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's ""critical raw materials"" are there. But accessing some of these resources will not be completely straightforward.
Some of the mineral deposits have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (£277bn) remain in occupied territories today.
There are warnings too that Ukraine first needs to addresses its problem with unexploded mines before striking a deal with the US.
A quarter of Ukraine's landmass is estimated to be contaminated with landmines, mainly concentrated in the war-torn east of the country.
Putin has also said he is open to offering the US access to rare minerals, including from Russian-occupied Ukraine.
UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will also be meeting both Trump and Zelensky separately this week to discuss the war in Ukraine.
He is due to arrive in Washington later on Wednesday.",0
US intelligence head 'not told' about UK's secret Apple data demand,"Tulsi Gabbard, the director of US National Intelligence, says she was not informed in advance about the UK government's demand to be able to access Apple customers' encrypted data from anywhere in the world.
Earlier this year, the UK government asked for the right to see the data, which currently not even Apple can access.
The tech giant last week took the unprecedented step of removing its highest level data security tool from customers in the UK.
In a letter, Ms Gabbard said she was seeking further information from the FBI and other US agencies and said, if the reports were true, the UK government's actions amounted to an ""egregious violation"" of US citizens' privacy.
The Home Office notice, which cannot legally be made public, was issued to Apple under the UK's Investigatory Powers Act in January.
Ms Gabbard added that she was also seeking legal advice over whether the UK had breached an agreement between it and the US not to demand data belonging to each other's citizens.
In response to the Home Office notice, last week Apple pulled its top level privacy tool, Advanced Data Protection, from the UK market.
Advanced Data Protection (ADP) means only account holders can view items such as photos or documents they have stored online through a process known as end-to-end encryption.
Apple would have to break its encryption systems in order to comply with the UK government demand, as currently it cannot see data protected in this way so would be unable to share it with law enforcement. This is something it says it will never do.
Apple's UK users' data remains encrypted in the UK but at a level which means it can be accessed by the tech giant if served with a warrant.
In the letter to Senator Ron Wyden and Representative Andy Biggs which has now been published online, Tulsi Gabbard said she first read about the notice in the media and had not been informed beforehand by either the UK or by Apple.
Apple did not comment. The Home Office referred the BBC to comments made earlier this week by security minister Dan Jarvis.
The Minister of State for Security said: ""I cannot comment on operational matters, and it would not be appropriate for me either to confirm or to deny the existence of any notices under the Investigatory Powers Act 2016.""
He added: ""What I can say is that the suggestion that privacy and security are at odds is not correct; we can and must have both.""
Meanwhile, two US lawmakers have also requested the US Department of Justice (DOJ) review the UK government's notice to Apple and its implications.
US Senator Alex Padilla and Representative Zoe Lofgren, two Democrats who both represent California, asked the DOJ to investigate whether the UK might have breached the terms of the US-UK Agreement on Access to Electronic Data for the Purpose of Countering Serious Crime.
""It is difficult to see the UK's notice to Apple, if the reports are accurate, as anything less than an action that undermines US law, public policy, and information security by requiring US companies to take such reckless action as undermining encryption for all users globally,"" the lawmakers said in a statement.

BP shuns renewables in return to oil and gas,"BP has announced it will cut its renewable energy investments and instead focus on increasing oil and gas production.
The energy giant revealed the shift in strategy on Wednesday following pressure from some investors unhappy its profits and share price have been lower than its rivals.
BP said it would increase its investments in oil and gas by about 20% to $10bn (£7.9bn) a year, while decreasing previously planned funding for renewables by more than $5bn (£3.9bn).
The move comes as rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's ""drill baby drill"" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels.
Murray Auchincloss, BP's chief executive, said the energy giant had gone ""too far, too fast"" in the transition away from fossil fuels, and that its faith in green energy was ""misplaced"".
He said BP would be ""very selective"" in investing in businesses working on the energy transition to renewables going forward, with funding reduced to between $1.5bn and $2bn per year.
He said this was part of a strategy ""reset"" by the company to focus on boosting returns for shareholders.
Helge Lund, chair of BP, added that the new direction of the firm had ""cash flow growth"" at its heart.
Shares in the company climbed before Tuesday's announcement but fell shortly after.
BP is one of several firms in the energy industry to return focus on oil and gas production, which has seen an increase in profits as prices have increased following lows seen during the Covid pandemic.
The firm said it plans to increase its production to between 2.3 million and 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2030, with hopes of ""major"" oil and gas projects starting by the end of 2027.
Mr Auchincloss is under pressure to boost profits from some shareholders, including the influential activist group Elliot Management, which took a near £4bn stake in the £70bn company to push for more investment in oil and gas.
In 2024, BP's net income fell to $8.9bn (£7.2bn), down from $13.8bn the previous year.
However, some other shareholders, as well as environmental groups have voiced concerns over switching focus back to fossil fuel production.
Last week, a group of 48 investors called on the company to allow them a vote on any potential plans to move away from commitments to renewables.
The environmental group Greenpeace UK said the latest move was ""proof that fossil fuel companies can't or won't be part of climate crisis solutions"".
Alexander Kirk from Global Witness added BP ""cannot be trusted to deliver the clean energy transition"", adding that it was ""focusing on short-term profits to shareholders while energy prices are high, with the rest of the world picking up the tab from its climate-wrecking products"".
Global Witness drove a lorry around central London with messages criticising BP's decision.
Sir Ian Cheshire, who has held many executive roles at companies such as B&Q owner Kingfisher and Barclays bank, questioned whether BP's latest move would work.
""I do wonder whether this sort of decision will look right in 10 years,"" he told the BBC's Today programme.
""The climate change issue has not gone away, the science hasn't changed,"" he said.
Challenged on the reduced commitment to investing in renewable energy, Louise Kingham, BP's senior vice president for Europe and the UK, said none of the changes announced on Tuesday would alter the UK's green energy plans, which include three wind farms and carbon capture projects.
She said the shift to renewable energy sources had slowed but that BP's ambition had ""not changed"" to become a net-zero company.
According to the International Energy Agency, no new fossil fuel projects are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels,
""We just have to do this transition more smartly and more efficiently and try to get those returns for our owners because they are helping us to do that. If we don't generate the returns, we can't invest and do more,"" Ms Kingham told the Scottish Affairs committee of MPs.
""It's going to take everybody to move in concert to make this happen. It's not just the decision of one company and what it chooses to do.""
The decrease in renewables will cover biogas, biofuels and electric vehicle charging projects, while BP will look to ""capital-light partnerships"" in other green energy such as wind and solar.
BP has already placed its offshore wind business in a joint venture with Japanese company Jera and is looking to find a partner to do the same with its solar business.
Five years ago, BP set some of the most ambitious targets among large oil companies to cut production of oil and gas by 40% by 2030, while significantly ramping up investment in renewables.
But in 2023, the company lowered this oil and gas reduction target to 25%.
In the five years since former chief executive Bernard Looney first unveiled his strategy, shareholders have received total returns including dividends of 36%.
In contrast, shareholders in rivals Shell and Exxon have seen returns of 82% and 160% respectively.
BP's under performance has prompted speculation that it may be a takeover target or may consider moving its main stock market listing to the US where oil and gas companies command higher valuations.

Apple boss says its DEI programmes may change,"Apple boss Tim Cook has said his company may have to change its diversity practices as the US legal landscape shifts.
His comments came just minutes after a majority of shareholders rejected a proposal calling on the tech giant to consider ending its diversity policies, such as the use of race and sex in hiring decisions.
Apple had urged shareholders to vote against the measure, which the company had argued was ""inappropriately"" trying ""to micromanage"" its business.
The scrutiny of the firm comes as US President Donald Trump has called for an end to diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programmes in the government and private sector, including at Apple.
In a social media post the day after the meeting, Trump ramped up the pressure on the company.
""Apple should get rid of DEI rules, not just make adjustments to them,"" he wrote in a all-capital-letters post. ""DEI was a hoax that has been very bad for our country. DEI is gone!!!""
Trump's DEI orders have run into legal roadblocks, but many companies in the US, including big names such as Meta, Amazon and Goldman Sachs, have already ended or rolled back their own policies, citing legal risks.
Apple's decision to fight the shareholder proposal had bucked that tide.
Shareholder measures opposed by companies rarely succeed, so the outcome of Tuesday's vote was expected.
It marked the second high-profile defeat of shareholder proposal targeting DEI, after a similar rejection at retailer Costco.
However, despite the vote, Mr Cook on Tuesday acknowledged that the firm may have to alter some of its practices.
""As the legal landscape around this issue evolves, we may need to make some changes to comply, but our north star of dignity and respect for everyone and our work to that end will never waver,"" Mr Cook said during a question-and-answer session at the company's annual shareholder meeting.
He noted that Apple did not use ""quotas"" for hiring - a practice that has come in for some of the fiercest criticism - while saying the firm's strength came from a culture where ""people with diverse backgrounds and perspectives come together"".
""We'll continue to work together to create a culture of belonging where everyone can do their best work,"" he added, saying the company would remain ""committed to the values that have always made us who we are"".
The proposal targeting Apple's DEI policies was backed by the National Center for Public Policy Research, a conservative think tank, which had also put forward the proposal at Costco.
It argued that the existence of Apple's diversity and inclusion programmes exposed the firm to ""litigation, reputational and financial risks"", pointing to the wider corporate retreat and noting that recent lawsuits have made it easier for workers to sue over discrimination.
Stefan Padfield of the organisation's Free Enterprise Project, who presented the proposal at Tuesday's meeting, said the risks to Apple had increased after the Trump administration recently ordered staff to investigate DEI in the private sector.
""The vibe shift is clear,"" he said. ""DEI is out and merit is in.""
Apple's decision to push back against the shareholder proposal, while simultaneously opening the door to changing its policy is an effort to satisfy both sides of the fight, said Angela Jackson, a senior advisor to the Project on Workforce at Harvard University and author of the forthcoming book, The Win-Win Workplace.
But she warned that it left Apple ""playing defence"". She said she wanted to see the company lead by making a more robust business case for the programmes.
""They've made the right moves. The one step they could go further... is to really say, 'Yes it's our values, we believe it's the right thing to do, but it's also an economic imperative.""
The fight over DEI in the US has raised questions about whether such policies in other countries will face similar challenges.
Catherine Howarth, chief executive of the responsible investment charity ShareAction, said she thought that Apple - a global, consumer-facing firm - had made the bet that the benefits of pushing back against the shareholder proposal outweighed the risks.
""It's not popular with consumers and it's not popular with employees to abandon what were supposedly your principles in this area until very recently,"" she said.
""They think it would go down very badly - and it would - with their global consumer base.""
Shareholders also rejected proposals that would have required Apple to report about its AI privacy practices, charitable giving and policies to combat child sex abuse.
They backed the board members supported by the company, as well as its executive compensation, including a pay package for Mr Cook worth more than $74m.",0
Tesla shares slump after European sales fall,"Shares in electric car maker Tesla have slumped more than 9% after EU and UK sales fell by almost half in January.
The drop in Tesla shares took the company's valuation back below $1trn for the first time since November 2024.
Tesla has been facing stiff competition in the European market from Chinese and other manufacturers.
In addition, Tesla owner Elon Musk has been making controversial political waves on both sides of the Atlantic, an analyst said.
Tesla sales in January bucked European electric car sale trends, which grew by more than a third in the month, according to trade body Acea.
Instead, Tesla sales across the EU, EFTA and the UK fell more than 45%, and more than 50% in the EU alone.
It comes after Tesla sales fell last year for the first time in more than a decade as demand faltered and rivals gained pace.
The main factor in the January sales slump was likely to be increasing competition, AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said.
Chinese manufacturer BYD has been making big strides, in part because it includes as standard some features which cost extra from other makers, Mould said.
However, some car buyers may also be taking a ""principled stand"" on Musk's political interventions, he said.
Musk has made waves in the US with his involvement in slashing US development funds and efforts to drastically reduce US federal funding.
In the UK he supports jailed far-right activist Stephen Yaxley-Lennon, also known as Tommy Robinson, and repeatedly criticised Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.
Musk also supports the far-right AfD party in Germany, and congratulated its leader after the party's record second-place result in elections.
Asked if the reason for Tesla's share price slump was down to Musk being too toxic, a former senior director of the car maker's Europe, Middle East and Asia division said it was ""definitely one of the reasons for the decline"", but added there was a ""cumulative number of things that are piling up a domino effect"".
""There's no doubt his flirting with the right in politics, running around on TV with a chainsaw is not exactly helping his image,"" Peter Bardenfleth-Hansen told the BBC's Today programme.
""He may be getting a bigger fanbase within a specific type of clientele, but they're not the ones that are buying the Teslas. They're not the ones putting money in to his company. So he has a problem.""
Tesla shares got a big boost after the US election due to Musk's closeness to Donald Trump - Musk has described himself as ""first buddy"" to the US president.
Investors thought this would stand his businesses in good stead.
However, Trump is not a supporter of electric vehicles, and has said he will cancel efforts to boost their ownership.
""How anybody thought this was going to be good for Tesla, I don't know,"" Mould said.
There is also general market skittishness about the path of interest rate cuts and concerns about Trump tariff plans that could be contributing to the fall, he added.",0
What we know about US-Ukraine minerals deal,"Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky will meet US President Trump in Washington on Friday to sign an agreement that would give the US access to its deposits of rare earth minerals.
Zelensky said he hoped the ""preliminary"" agreement with the US ""will lead to further deals"", but confirmed no American security guarantees have been agreed yet.
Trump said a deal would help American taxpayers ""get their money back"" for aid sent to Ukraine throughout the war but said the responsibility of Kyiv's security should fall to Europe.
Key details have not yet been made public, but on Wednesday Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine and the US had finalised a version of the agreement.
Speaking to Ukrainian TV, Shmyhal said the preliminary agreement envisages that an ""investment fund"" would be set up for Ukraine's reconstruction.
Kyiv and Washington would manage the fund on ""equal terms"", the prime minister added.
He said Ukraine would contribute 50% of future proceeds from state-owned mineral resources, oil and gas to the fund, and the fund would then invest in projects in Ukraine itself.
Zelensky has acknowledged the fund but told the BBC on Wednesday it was ""too early to talk about money"".
The New York Times reported, citing a draft document, that the US would own the maximum amount of the fund allowed under US law, but not necessarily all of it.
Disagreement over the terms of a minerals deal formed part of what was seen as a deepening rift between Trump and Zelensky in recent weeks.
The Ukrainian president had rejected an initial request from the US for $500bn (£395bn) in mineral wealth, but media reports say this demand has now been dropped.
""The provisions of the deal are much better for Ukraine now,"" a source in Ukraine's government told the BBC.
On Tuesday, Trump said the US had given Ukraine between $300bn (£237bn) and $350bn (£276bn) in aid, and that he wanted to ""get that money back"" through a deal.
But German think tank the Kiel Institute estimates the US has sent $119bn in aid to Ukraine.
Zelensky has been pushing for a deal to include a firm security guarantee from the US.
But on Wednesday, Ukraine's leader said no such guarantee had been made.
""I wanted to have a sentence on security guarantees for Ukraine, and it's important that it's there,"" he said.
Asked by the BBC if he would be prepared to walk away from the agreement if Trump did not offer the guarantees he wanted, Zelensky said: ""I want to find a Nato path or something similar.
""If we don't get security guarantees, we won't have a ceasefire, nothing will work, nothing.""
Despite this, Shmyhal said on Wednesday the US supported ""Ukraine's efforts to obtain security guarantees to build lasting peace"".
He said Ukraine would not sign the deal until Zelensky and Trump ""agree on security guarantees"" and decide on how to ""tie this preliminary agreement"" to a US security guarantee.
Trump said on Wednesday that the US would not provide security guarantees ""beyond... very much"", saying responsibility for this fell to Europe.
But he added that the presence of American workers on Ukrainian soil would provide ""automatic security"".
The prospect of a minerals deal was first proposed by Zelensky last year as a way to offer the US a tangible reason to continue supporting Ukraine.
Trump said on Tuesday that Ukraine would get ""the right to fight on"" in return for access to its minerals and suggested the US would continue to supply equipment and ammunition ""until we have a deal with Russia"".
The US president has also said Russia is open to accepting European peacekeepers in Ukraine, but Russia's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said the Kremlin would not consider this as an option.
Shmyhal said the US and Ukraine have prepared a final version of the agreement, which Ukraine's government will authorise for signing on Wednesday.
Zelensky said he would be ""very direct"" with Trump by asking whether the US would continue supporting Ukraine or not.
Trump has confirmed he will be meeting Zelensky in Washington on Friday to sign the agreement.
Kyiv estimates that about 5% of the world's ""critical raw materials"" are in Ukraine.
This includes some 19m tonnes of proven reserves of graphite, which the Ukrainian Geological Survey state agency says makes the nation ""one of the top five leading countries"" for the supply of the mineral. Graphite is used to make batteries for electric vehicles.
Ukraine also has significant deposits of titanium, lithium and rare earth metals - a group of 17 elements that are used to produce weapons, wind turbines, electronics and other products vital in the modern world.
But some of the country's mineral deposits have been seized by Russia. According to Yulia Svyrydenko, Ukraine's economy minister, resources worth $350bn (£277bn) remain in occupied territories today.
There are warnings too that a deal allowing the US access to Ukraine's vast mineral wealth cannot happen unless the country addresses its problem with unexploded mines.
A quarter of Ukraine's landmass is estimated to be contaminated with landmines, mainly concentrated in the war-torn east of the country.
Vladimir Putin has not yet addressed reports that the terms of a deal between the US and Ukraine have been agreed.
But on Monday evening he told state TV he was ready to ""offer"" resources to American partners in joint projects, including mining in Russia's ""new territories"" - a reference to parts of eastern Ukraine that Russia has occupied since launching a full-scale invasion three years ago.
Putin said a potential US-Ukraine deal on rare minerals was not a concern and that Russia ""undoubtedly have, I want to emphasise, significantly more resources of this kind than Ukraine"".
""As for the new territories, it's the same. We are ready to attract foreign partners to the so-called new, to our historical territories, which have returned to the Russian Federation,"" he added.
Commenting on Zelensky's visit to Washington, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Tuesday: ""Whether it will be [to sign] the aforementioned agreement or something else, we'll see. There have been no official statements on this matter yet.""",0
Aston Martin cuts 170 jobs after fall in sales,"Aston Martin has cut 170 jobs after losses widened by a fifth last year and fewer cars were sold in 2023 following a string of supply chain issues and production delays.
The luxury auto manufacturer, which has its headquarters in Gaydon, Warwickshire, said it planned to axe 5% of the workforce as part of cost-cutting measures to return to profit.
All of the company's departments have been hit, including manufacturing, office jobs and management.
In a statement on Wednesday, the company said the aim was to make sure the company was ""appropriately resourced for its future plans"", and called the cuts a ""difficult but necessary action"".
Aston Martin - famous for making fictional spy James Bond's cars - said it was targeting yearly savings of £25m and expected to hit about half of that total this year.
Since it was bought by Canadian billionaire Lawrence Stroll in 2020, the company has pushed on with a swathe of new model launches in a bid to turn its ailing fortunes around.
Adrian Hallmark was appointed the company's new chief executive in September amid a ramping up of sales of its new Vantage and DBX707 models, which it said helped boost production volumes.
The company also launched its flagship Vanquish model in September.
Aston Martin said the launches helped boost sales later in the year as it started delivering more of the new models to customers, with wholesale volumes picking up 10% year on year in the second half compared with 2023.
But the company's wholesale volumes for the whole year were still down 9% at 6,030 cars, pushing its pre-tax losses to gape by a further 21% to £289 million.
It also saw its debt pile rise by 43% to £1.16bn during the year, while shares were down about 33% over the last year.
Mr Hallmark said it was ""a period of intense product launches, coupled with industry-wide and company challenges"".
He said he wanted Aston Martin to ""transition from a high-potential business to a high-performing one, better equipped to navigate future opportunities and uncertainties"".

Billion Indians have no spending money - report,"India is home to 1.4 billion people but around a billion lack money to spend on any discretionary goods or services, a new report estimates.
The country's consuming class, effectively the potential market for start-ups or business owners, is only about as big as Mexico, 130-140 million people, according to the report from Blume Ventures, a venture capital firm.
Another 300 million are ""emerging"" or ""aspirant"" consumers but they are reluctant spenders who have only just begun to open their purse strings, as click-of-a-button digital payments make it easy to transact.
What is more, the consuming class in Asia's third largest economy is not ""widening"" as much as it is ""deepening"", according to the report. That basically means India's wealthy population is not really growing in numbers, even though those who are already rich are getting even wealthier.
All of this is shaping the country's consumer market in distinct ways, particularly accelerating the trend of ""premiumisation"" where brands drive growth by doubling down on expensive, upgraded products catering to the wealthy, rather than focusing on mass-market offerings.
This is evident in zooming sales of ultra-luxury gated housing and premium phones, even as their lower-end variants struggle. Affordable homes now constitute just 18% of India's overall market compared with 40% five years ago. Branded goods are also capturing a bigger share of the market. And the ""experience economy"" is booming, with expensive tickets for concerts by international artists like Coldplay and Ed Sheeran selling like hot cakes.
Companies that have adapted to these shifts have thrived, Sajith Pai, one of the report's authors, told the BBC. ""Those who are too focused at the mass end or have a product mix that doesn't have exposure to the premium end have lost market share.""
The report's findings bolster the long-held view that India's post-pandemic recovery has been K-shaped - where the rich have got richer, while the poor have lost purchasing power.
In fact, this has been a long-term structural trend that began even before the pandemic. India has been getting increasingly more unequal, with the top 10% of Indians now holding 57.7% of national income compared with 34% in 1990. The bottom half have seen their share of national income fall from 22.2% to 15%.
The latest consumption slump, however, has deepened amid not just a destruction in purchasing power, but also a precipitous drop in financial savings and surging indebtedness among the masses.
The country's central bank has also cracked down on easy unsecured lending that propped up demand after the Covid pandemic.
Much of the consumption spending of the ""emerging"" or ""aspirant"" class of Indians was led by such borrowing and ""turning off that tap will definitely have some impact on consumption"", says Pai.
In the short run, two things are expected to help boost spending - a pick-up in rural demand on the back of a record harvest and a $12 billion tax give-away in the recently concluded budget. It will not be ""dramatic"" but could boost India's GDP - largely driven by consumption - by over half a percent, says Pai.
But major longer-term headwinds remain.
India's middle class - which has been a major engine for consumer demand - is being squeezed out, with wages pretty much staying flat, according to data compiled by Marcellus Investment Managers.
""The middle 50% of India's tax-paying population has seen its income stagnate in absolute terms over the past decade. This implies a halving of income in real terms [adjusted for inflation],"" says the report, published in January.
""This financial hammering has decimated the middle class's savings - the RBI [Reserve Bank of India] has repeatedly highlighted that net financial savings of Indian households are approaching a 50-year low. This pounding suggests that products and services associated with middle-class household spending are likely to face a rough time in the years ahead,"" it adds.
The Marcellus report also points out that white-collar urban jobs are becoming harder to come by as artificial intelligence automates clerical, secretarial and other routine work. ""The number of supervisors employed in manufacturing units [as a percentage of all employed] in India has gone down significantly,"" it adds.
The government's recent economic survey has flagged these concerns as well.
It says labour displacement as a result of these technological advancements is of particular concern for a mainly services-driven economy like India, where a significant share of the IT workforce is employed in low value-added services sectors that are most prone to disruption.
""India is also a consumption-based economy, thus the fall in consumption that can result from the displacement of its workforce is bound to have macroeconomic implications. If the worst-case projections materialise, this could have the potential to set the country's economic growth trajectory off course,"" the survey says.

Did Iron Age 'begin' in India? Tamil Nadu dig sparks debate,"For over 20 years, archaeologists in India's southern state of Tamil Nadu have been unearthing clues to the region's ancient past.
Their digs have uncovered early scripts that rewrite literacy timelines, mapped maritime trade routes connecting India to the world and revealed advanced urban settlements - reinforcing the state's role as a cradle of early civilisation and global commerce.
Now they've also uncovered something even older - evidence of what could be the earliest making and use of iron. Present-day Turkey is one of the earliest known regions where iron was mined, extracted and forged on a significant scale around the 13th Century BC.
Archaeologists have discovered iron objects at six sites in Tamil Nadu, dating back to 2,953–3,345 BCE, or between 5,000 to 5,400 years old. This suggests that the process of extracting, smelting, forging and shaping iron to create tools, weapons and other objects may have developed independently in the Indian subcontinent.
""The discovery is of such a great importance that it will take some more time before its implications sink in,"" says Dilip Kumar Chakrabarti, a professor of South Asian archaeology at Cambridge University.
The latest findings from Adichchanallur, Sivagalai, Mayiladumparai, Kilnamandi, Mangadu and Thelunganur sites have made local headlines such as ""Did the Iron Age Begin in Tamil Nadu?"" The age marks a period when societies began using and producing iron widely, making tools, weapons and infrastructure.
Parth R Chauhan, a professor of archaeology at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (ISSER), urges caution before drawing broad conclusions. He believes that iron technology likely emerged ""independently in multiple regions"".
Also, the ""earliest evidence remains uncertain because many regions of the world have not been properly researched or archaeological evidence is known but has not been dated properly"".
If the Tamil Nadu discovery is further validated through rigorous academic study, ""it would certainly rank amongst the world's earliest records"", Mr Chauhan says. Oishi Roy, an archaeologist at ISSER, adds that the find ""suggests parallel developments [in iron production] across different parts of the world"".
Early iron came in two forms - meteoritic and smelted. Smelted iron, extracted from ore, marked the true beginning of iron technology with mass production. The earliest known iron artefacts - nine tubular beads - were made from meteoritic iron, which comes from fallen meteorites.
Identifying iron-bearing rocks is the first challenge. Once located, these ores must be smelted in a furnace at extremely high temperatures to extract the metal. Without this process, raw iron remains locked within the rock. After extraction, skilled ironsmiths shape the metal into tools and implements, marking a crucial step in early ironworking.
Most sites in Tamil Nadu where iron has been found are ancient habitation areas near present-day villages. Archaeologists K Rajan and R Sivanantham say that excavators have so far explored a fraction of over 3,000 identified Iron Age graves containing sarcophagi (stone coffins) and a wealth of iron artefacts. In the process, they uncovered hoe-spades, spears, knives, arrowheads, chisels, axes and swords made of iron.
At burials excavated at one site, over 85 iron objects - knives, arrowhead, rings, chisels, axes and swords - were found inside and outside burial urns. More than 20 key samples were robustly dated in five labs worldwide, confirming their antiquity.
Some finds are particularly striking.
Historian Osmund Bopearachchi of the Paris-based French National Centre for Scientific Research highlights a key discovery - an iron sword from a burial site, made of ultra-high-carbon steel and dating to 13th–15th Century BC.
This advanced steel, a direct evolution of Iron Age metallurgy, required sophisticated knowledge and precise high-temperature processes.
""We know that the first signs of real steel production date back to the 13th Century BC in present-day Turkey. The radiometric dates seem to prove that the Tamil Nadu samples are earlier,"" he said. Ms Roy adds that the early steel in Tamil Nadu indicates the people there ""were iron makers, not just users - a technologically advanced community evolving over time"".
Also, in a site called Kodumanal, excavators found a furnace, pointing to an advanced iron-making community.
The furnace area stood out with its white discolouration, likely from extreme heat. Nearby, excavators found iron slag - some of it fused to the furnace wall - hinting at advanced metalworking techniques. Clearly the people at the site were not just using iron, but actively producing and processing it.
To be sure, the Tamil Nadu excavations are not the first in India to uncover iron. At least 27 sites across eight states have revealed evidence of early iron use, some dating back 4,200 years. The latest Tamil Nadu digs pushes back the antiquity of Indian iron by another 400 years,"" archaeologist Rajan, who has co-authored a paper on the subject, told me.
""The Iron Age is a technological shift, not a single-origin event - it develops in multiple places independently,"" says Ms Roy, noting earlier discoveries in eastern, western and northern India.
""What's clear now,"" she adds, ""is that indigenous iron technology developed early in the Indian subcontinent.""
Experts say the excavations in Tamil Nadu are significant and could reshape our understanding of the Iron Age and iron smelting in the Indian subcontinent. Also, ""what these digs testify is to the existence of a distinctly sophisticated style of civilisation,"" notes Nirmala Lakshman, author of The Tamils - A Portrait of a Community.
However, archaeologists caution that there is still a lack of excavations needed to collect fresh data from all over India. As one expert put it, ""Indian archaeology is in silent mode outside Tamil Nadu.""
Katragadda Paddayya, a leading Indian archaeologist, said this was ""just the starting point"".
""We need to delve deeper into the origins of iron technology - these findings mark the beginning, not the conclusion. The key is to use this as a premise, trace the process backward and identify the sites where iron production truly began.""",0
The 'hero' ship fixing Africa's internet blackouts - the BBC goes aboard,"A ship the size of a football field, crewed by more than 50 engineers and technicians, cruises the oceans around Africa to keep the continent online.
It provides a vital service, as last year's internet blackout showed when internet cables buried deep under the sea were damaged.
Millions from Lagos to Nairobi were plunged into digital darkness: messaging apps crashed and banking transactions failed. It left businesses and individuals struggling.
It was the Léon Thévenin which fixed the multiple cable failures. The ship, where a BBC team recently spent a week on board off the coast of Ghana, has been doing this specialised repair work for the last 13 years
""Because of me, countries stay connected,"" Shuru Arendse, a cable jointer from South Africa who has been working on the ship for more than a decade, tells the BBC.
""IT people at home have work because I bring the main feed in,"" he says.
""You have heroes that save lives - I'm a hero because I save communication.""
His pride and passion reflect the sentiment of the skilled crew on the Léon Thévenin, which stands eight floors high and carries an assortment of equipment.
The internet is a network of computers servers - to read this article it is likely that at least one of 600 fibre optic cables across the world collected the data to present it on your screen.
Most of these servers are in data centres outside of Africa and the fibre optic cables run along the ocean floor linking them to coastal cities on the continent.
Data travels through hair-thin fibreglass wires, often grouped in pairs and protected by different layers of plastic and copper depending on how close the cables are to the shore.
""As long as the servers aren't in the country, you need a connection. A cable runs from one country to the next, linking users to servers that store their data - whether it's accessing Facebook or any other online service,"" says Benjamin Smith, the Léon Thévenin's deputy chief of mission.
Undersea fibre optic cables are designed to work for 25 years with minimal maintenance, but when they are damaged, it is usually due to human activity.
""The cable generally doesn't break on its own unless you're in an area where there are pretty high currents and very sharp rocks,"" says Charles Heald, who is in charge of the ship's remotely operated vehicle (ROV).
""But most of the time it's people anchoring where they shouldn't and fishing trawlers sometimes scrape along the seabed, so typically we would see scars from trawling.""
Mr Smith also says natural disasters cause damage to cables, especially in parts of the continent with extreme weather conditions. He gives an example of the seas off the coast of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the Congo River empties into the Atlantic.
""In the Congo Canyon, where they have a lot of rainfall and low tide, it could create currents that damage the cable,"" he says.
Deliberate sabotage is difficult to identify - but the Léon Thévenin crew say they not seen any obvious evidence of this themselves.
A year ago, three critical cables in the Red Sea - Seacom, AAE-1 and EIG - were severed, reportedly by a ship's anchor, disrupting connectivity for millions across East Africa, including Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Mozambique.
Just a month later, in March 2024, a separate set of breaks in the Wacs, Ace, Sat-3, and MainOne cables off the coast of West Africa caused severe internet blackouts across Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Liberia.
Anything that required the internet to function felt the strain as repairs stretched on for weeks.
Then in May, yet another setback: the Seacom and Eassy cables suffered damage off the coast of South Africa, hitting connectivity in multiple East African nations once again.
Such faults are detected by testing electricity and signal strength transmitted through cables.
""There may be 3,000 volts in a cable and suddenly it drops to 50 volts, this means there's a problem,"" explains Loic Wallerand, the ship's chief of mission.
There are local teams with the capacity to deal with faults in shallow waters, but if they are detected beyond a depth of 50m (164ft), the ship is called into action. Its crew can fix cables deeper than 5,000m below sea level.
The repair witnessed by the BBC off Ghana took over a week to deal with, but most internet users did not notice as traffic was redirected to another cable.
The nature of every repair depends on the part of the cable that is damaged.
If the fibreglass at the core breaks, it means the data cannot travel along the network and needs to be sent to another cable.
But some African countries have only one cable serving them. This means a cable damaged this way leaves the affected area without the internet.
At other times, the protective layers of the fibre could be damaged, meaning data transmission still occurs, but with a lower efficiency. In both cases, the crew must find the exact location of the damage.
In the case of broken fibreglass, a light signal is sent through the cable and through its point of reflection, the crew can determine where the break is.
When the problem is with the cable's insulation - known as a ""shunt fault"" - it becomes more complicated and an electrical signal has to be sent along the cable to physically track where it is lost.
After narrowing down the possible area for the fault, the operation moves to the ROV team.
Built like a bulldozer, the ROV, weighing 9.5 tonnes, is lowered under water from the ship where it is guided down to the ocean floor.
About five crew members work with a crane operator to deploy it - once it is released from its harness, called the umbilical cord, it floats gracefully.
""It doesn't sink,"" says Mr Heald, explaining how it uses four horizontal and vertical thrusters to move in any direction.
The ROV's three cameras allow the team onboard to look for the precise location of faults as it moves to the ocean bed.
Once found, the ROV cuts the affected part using its two arms, then ties it to a rope that is dragged back to the ship.
Here the faulty section is isolated and replaced by splicing and joining it to a new cable - a process that looks like welding and which took 24 hours in the case of the operation witnessed by the BBC.
Afterwards the cable was carefully lowered back to the ocean bed and then the ROV made one final journey to inspect that it was well placed and take coordinates so maps could be updated.
When an alert is received about a damaged cable, the Léon Thévenin crew is ready to sail within 24 hours. However, their response time depends on several factors: the ship's location, the availability of spare cables and bureaucratic challenges.
""Permits can take weeks. Sometimes we sail to the affected country and wait offshore until the paperwork is sorted,"" Mr Wallerand says.
On the average, the crew spends more than six months at sea every year.
""It's part of the job,"" says Captain Thomas Quehec.
But talking to the crew members between tasks, it is hard to ignore their personal sacrifices.
They are drawn from different backgrounds and nationalities: French, South African, Filipino, Malagasy and more.
Adrian Morgan, the ship's chief steward from South Africa, has missed five consecutive wedding anniversaries.
""I wanted to quit. It was difficult to stay away from my family, but my wife encouraged me. I do it for them,"" he says.
Another South African, maintenance fitter Noel Goeieman, is worried he may miss his son's wedding in a few weeks if the ship is called out to another mission.
""I've heard we might go to Durban [in South Africa]. My son is going to be very sad because he doesn't have a mum,"" says Mr Goeieman, who lost his wife three years ago.
""But I'm retiring in six months,"" he adds with a smile.
Despite the emotional toll, there is camaraderie onboard.
When off-duty, crew members are either playing video games in the lounge or sharing meals in the ship's mess hall.
Their entry into the profession is as diverse as their background.
While Mr Goeieman followed his father's footsteps, chief cook, South African Remario Smith, went to sea to escape a life of crime.
""I was involved in gangs when I was younger,"" Mr Smith says, ""My child was born when I turned 25, and I knew I had to change my life.""
Like the others onboard he is appreciative of the role the ship plays on the continent.
""We are the link between Africa and the world,"" says chief engineer Ferron Hartzenberg.

Katy Perry to head to space on Blue Origin all-women flight,"Pop star Katy Perry will blast off into space as part of an upcoming all-women flight on Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket.
The Firework singer will be joined by Blue Origin owner Jeff Bezos's fiancee Lauren Sanchez, CBS presenter Gayle King, former Nasa rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerianne Flynn.
Blue Origin said this is the first all-women space flight to take place since the Soviet Union's Valentina Tereshkova's solo mission in 1963.
There is no specific date for the launch, but Blue Origin said it would take place this spring.
Katy Perry is scheduled to be on her Lifetimes Tour from 23 April until 11 November, so this trip is expected to take place before that.
""If you had told me I'd be part of the first all-female crew in space, I would have believed you. Nothing was beyond my imagination as a child,"" Perry said in a statement cited by Newsweek.
The NS-31 mission will be the 11th human spaceflight for the New Shepard rocket and the 31st in its history. So far, the programme has launched 52 people into space.
A trip on the New Shepard typically lasts about 11 minutes, according to Blue Origin. It is fully autonomous - which means there are no pilots - and takes the passengers past the Karman line, internationally recognised as the edge of space.
Blue Origin credited Lauren Sanchez for bringing the mission together, saying in its press release that she is ""honored to lead a team of explorers on a mission that will challenge their perspectives of Earth, empower them to share their own stories, and create lasting impact that will inspire generations to come"".
Sanchez first announced her plan to fly with an all-women crew on a Blue Origin rocket in 2023 in an interview with Vogue, saying they were ""paving the way for women"".
This is the latest group of celebrities to embark on a flight to space.
Bezos himself flew on the company's first manned mission in 2021. Good Morning America's co-host Michael Strahan and Star Trek actor William Shatner have also been blasted into space on one of Bezos's rockets.
Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Galactic, made a trip aboard his company's VSS Unity spacecraft in July 2021. SpaceX founder Elon Musk, however, is yet to make a trip.",0

Amazon joins quantum race with 'cat qubit' powered chip,"Amazon has become the third tech giant in as many months to announce a breakthrough in quantum computing - a technology that promises vast processing power but is beset by technical difficulties.
The firm has unveiled Ocelot a prototype chip built on ""cat qubit"" technology - an approach that derives its name from the famous ""Schrödinger's cat"" thought experiment.
The chip seeks to address one of the biggest stumbling blocks to the development of quantum computers - making them error free.
Amazon says, taken alongside other recent breakthroughs in the industry, its work means useful quantum computers are likely to be with us sooner than previously thought.
But how quickly these machines will be powerful enough to be practically useful for a range of commercial applications is a matter of debate among experts.
Oskar Painter of Amazon Web Services (AWS) Center for Quantum Computing at the California Institute of Technology, where the work was carried out, told the BBC that recent progress meant an ""aggressive date"" of a decade was now ""looking more and more realistic"".
""Five years ago I would have said maybe 20 or 30 years"", he said but added ""this timeline's come in quite a bit.""
Ultimately AWS, which provides cloud computing services, would like to offer quantum computing services to its customers, but Mr Painter also said he believed the advanced machines could eventually help optimise the vast global logistics of Amazon's retail business.
""You know, a company like Amazon, you make a one percent improvement in that and you're talking large dollars right? Quantum computers could enable you to do that more effectively, more real time - and that's the real value there,"" he explained.
Quantum computers solve problems by exploiting the strange properties of matter and energy at very small scales, as described by the science of quantum physics.
Quantum computers won't replace so-called ""classical"" computers, but promise to be able to solve problems even the most powerful modern computers cannot - yielding new discoveries such as better batteries and new medicines.
But that potential is being held up by the problem of errors.
Quantum computers are extremely sensitive to noise in their environment - vibrations, heat, electromagnetic interference from mobile phones and WIFI networks, or even cosmic rays and radiation from outer space can all cause them to make errors, which then need to be corrected.
Cat qubits are one attempt at solving this problem by engineering error resistance into the design of the qubits it uses.
Qubits are the fundamental elements of quantum computers, the equivalent of bits in the computers most of us use today.
Cat qubits are named in honour of Erwin Schrödinger, whose cat-in-a-box question in 1935 helped illuminate some of the thinking behind quantum theory.
Amazon believes the new chip, which has just five cat qubits out of a total of 14 key components, could reduce the costs of correcting quantum errors by up to 90%, compared to current approaches.
The technology of cat qubits isn't exclusive to Amazon, a French company named Alice & Bob carried out pioneering work on the tech and continues to evolve the technology.
Mazyar Mirrahimi director of research at the French national technology research institute, Inria said Ocelot was ""an important step forward towards hardware-efficient fault-tolerant quantum computation"".
Amazon believes the new chip offers a path to scaling up to more powerful machines with this type of error proofing built in, but researchers admit there are many challenges ahead.
Michael Cuthbert director of the UK's National Quantum Computing Centre welcomed the progress Amazon had made but told the BBC it remained to be seen the effect it would have on the speed with which the industry is able to develop really useful quantum computers:
""Error correction is a vital step necessary in the long-term development of quantum computing. It is the crucial step that turns quantum computing into a practical and commercial tool we can use to solve complex problems in chemistry, materials science, medicine, logistics and energy.""
""Part of the challenge is how to scale the revolutionary technology efficiently – mechanisms that enable error correction without huge overheads in chip size, energy consumption and systems complexity are really welcome.""
Amazon researchers have published their findings in a research paper in the scientific journal Nature
Amazon joins Microsoft and Google in announcing a new experimental chip. But is this flurry of announcements the result of clever research or clever PR? Or is it coincidence, the tech equivalent of the saying buses always come in threes?
Heather West follows the quantum computing industry as a research manager for the International Data Corporation and was briefed on the new chip by Amazon in advance of publication.
She describes Amazon's results as an ""advancement"" rather than a breakthrough.
All three recent announcements have focused on reducing errors, and she tells me the industry is ""pivoting"" from a focus on the number of qubits to a focus the ""ability to use these these systems at scale to solve real world life problems. And by doing so we need to be able to solve the error correction within the quantum systems"".
However Mr Painter agreed ""100%"" that it wouldn't be easy to scale up today's experimental systems.",0

'Innovation village' to go ahead despite LGI delay,"Work on a new ""innovation village"" linked to Leeds General Infirmary is set to continue, despite a plan to rebuild the hospital being delayed until 2030.
The proposed hub, which is designed to link the city's two universities to the hospital, is ""crucial"" to developing new technology, medical start-ups say.
When Guarav Chauhan was involved in a serious car crash he spent more than a year wearing casts and splints on his neck, arms and knees.
Like many he was plagued by discomfort, itching, and odours as a result of the tight-fitting plaster.
But, working with fellow engineering graduate Ali Abdi, he used his experiences and knowledge of 3D printing to find a solution.
Together they developed a lightweight, waterproof splint with the help of Nexus Leeds, the collaboration and innovation hub of the University of Leeds, and launched Cast3D.
Mr Abdi said access to Nexus had given them the chance to collaborate with academics and the hospitals.
He said: ""Those collaborations and introductions really allowed us to do the clinical developments to come to the point where we're now doing clinical trials.""
He said having a space in the city for technology to be ""developed, tested and introduced"" was ""very important"" and that developing the innovation village would ""mean the success of some of these technologies"".
Since its launch in 2019, Nexus has worked with 191 companies. It said more than half of its member businesses were health tech innovators.
Little Journey is an app which helps prepare children for hospital treatment and is now used in around 100 hospitals worldwide.
It was founded in 2018 by anaesthetist Dr Chris Evans and Sophie Copley to help children and their families overcome their fears.
Ms Copley said the support they received through Nexus was vital.
""Two people alone can't make it happen [but we] got support with funding and were able to develop the product through a healthcare system,"" she said.
Bruno Scaglioni's team have also benefitted from being part of the healthcare innovation hub at Nexus.
Atlas Endoscopy is working to improve access to colonoscopies through specialist robotic technology using magnetics.
The company has trialled the technique in America and is hoping to carry out a wider trial in the UK this year.
He said being part of a hub like the one in Leeds had been ""crucial, because we are next to the university, we are next to the hospital, we are in a place an ecosystem that attracts talent"".
""For high-tech companies like us, the team and the people who are part of the company are really the biggest asset you can have,"" he said.
""There is no way to attract talent if you don't have an ecosystem around you.""
Under hospital plans, the new innovation village would be built across five hectares between Calverley Street and Woodhouse Square and based around the Old Medical School.
Prof Phil Wood, chief executive of Leeds Teaching Hospitals, said it was estimated the development would create 4,000 jobs and provide a £13bn boost to West Yorkshire's economy.
There had been fears the proposal would be shelved after the government said the redevelopment of LGI would not begin before 2032.
But Prof Wood said leaders in the city had pulled together to make sure the innovation district kept going.
""Plan A was that that was going to be part of the back of the hospital but, in the last few weeks, we've come together to see how we keep the innovation district going,"" he said.
James Lewis, the leader of Leeds City Council, said the authority was ""absolutely committed"" to ""stimulating innovation and economic growth"", adding that the innovation village would ""further solidify Leeds' position as a global health-tech hub"".
However, Alec Shelbrooke, Conservative MP for Wetherby and Easingwold, told the BBC he had ""'zero confidence"" the work would happen as ""nothing is being built"".
It is hoped the redevelopment of the Old Medical School will begin by the end of the year, with developers Scarborough Group International hopeful they will be able to complete the work by the middle of 2027.

What the Online Safety Act is - and how to keep children safe online,"Technology companies will have to take more action to keep children in the UK safe on the internet, following the introduction of the Online Safety Act.
The new rules come in during 2025 - but critics say they do not go far enough.
Children aged eight to 17 spend between two and five hours online per day, research by the communications regulator Ofcom suggests. Time spent online increases with age.
Nearly every child over 12 has a mobile phone and almost all of them watch videos on platforms such as YouTube or TikTok.
Four in five teenagers who go online say they have used artificial intelligence (AI) tools such as ChatGPT or Snapchat's MyAI.
About half of children over 12 think being online is good for their mental health, according to Ofcom.
But one in eight children aged eight to 17 have said someone had been nasty or hurtful to them on social media, or messaging apps.
The Children's Commissioner said that half of the 13-year-olds her team surveyed reported seeing ""hardcore, misogynistic"" pornographic material on social media sites.
Two-thirds of parents say they use controls to limit what their children see online, according to Internet Matters -a safety organisation set up by some of the big UK-based internet companies.
It has a list of parental controls available and step-by-step guides on how to use them.
On YouTube - the most popular platform for young people in the UK - parents who want to try to prevent their children seeing unsuitable material can set up the ""kids"" version, which filters out adult content.
Parents can also set up supervised accounts to review the content that older children using YouTube's main site can find and watch.
Supervision can also be set up on Facebook Messenger, via its Family Centre.
Its parent company Meta provides parental controls across its social media apps such as daily time limits, scheduled break times and information the content their child interacts with.
Instagram, also owned by Meta, has introduced teen accounts for under-18s whichsets them to private by default.
Similarly, under-13s on Roblox must get parental consent in order to have private, in-game conversations.
TikTok says its family pairing tool lets parents decide whether to make a teenager's account private.
But such controls are not fool-proof. Ofcom data has suggested that about one in 20 children uses workarounds.
Phone networks may block some explicit websites until a user has demonstrated they are over 18.
Some also have parental controls that can limit the websites children can visit on their phones.
Android and Apple phones and tablets also have controls for parents.
These can block or limit access to specific apps, restrict explicit content, prevent purchases and monitor browsing.
Apple has Child Accounts and Google has Family Link. There are similar apps available from third-party developers.
Later in 2025, Apple says it will let parents share their child's age range - rather than their date of birth - linked to their child's account with app developers, to help them provide age-appropriate experiences.
Broadband services also have parental controls to filter certain types of content.
Game console controls also let parents ensure age-appropriate gaming and control in-game purchases.
Talking to children about online safety and taking an interest in what they do online is important, according to the NSPCC.
It recommends making discussions about it part of daily conversation, just like a chat about their day at school, which can make it easier for children to share any concerns they have.
The Online Safety Act aims to make social media firms and search engines protect children and adults in the UK from illegal, harmful material.
It became law in 2023, with duties for platforms coming into effect in 2025.
The Act will require platforms to show they are committed to removing illegal content, including:
Pornography sites will have to stop children viewing content, by checking ages.
Duties to protect children from harmful content, also include addressing harms disproportionately affecting women and girls, such as intimate image abuse and harassment.
The Act has also created new offences, such as:
It also makes it easier for bereaved parents to obtain information about their children from technology companies.
Ofcom, the regulator tasked with enforcing the Act, has been given additional powers to ensure companies comply with the rules.
It requires online platforms to they assess if and where users - particularly children - may be exposed to certain types of illegal or harmful content on their services.
Platforms must then detail measures to prevent this, in accordance with Ofcom's codes and guidance.
Ofcom's chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes has warned that services failing to follow the rules could have their minimum user age raised to 18.
Some parents of children who died after exposure to harmful online content have called the Online Safety Act ""insufficient"" and criticised its delays.
Bereaved parents including Ian Russell, father of Molly, and Esther Ghey, mother of Brianna, have said the legislation should impose tougher rules and a duty of care on tech firms.
In August 2024, following riots across the UK, London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the Act did not adequately tackle misinformation.
Some civil liberties groups meanwhile believe its content measures risk stifling free expression online.
Requirements for porn sites to use technology for ""robust age checks"" have also raised privacy and security concerns.",0

US intelligence head 'not told' about UK's secret Apple data demand,"Tulsi Gabbard, the director of US National Intelligence, says she was not informed in advance about the UK government's demand to be able to access Apple customers' encrypted data from anywhere in the world.
Earlier this year, the UK government asked for the right to see the data, which currently not even Apple can access.
The tech giant last week took the unprecedented step of removing its highest level data security tool from customers in the UK.
In a letter, Ms Gabbard said she was seeking further information from the FBI and other US agencies and said, if the reports were true, the UK government's actions amounted to an ""egregious violation"" of US citizens' privacy.
The Home Office notice, which cannot legally be made public, was issued to Apple under the UK's Investigatory Powers Act in January.
Ms Gabbard added that she was also seeking legal advice over whether the UK had breached an agreement between it and the US not to demand data belonging to each other's citizens.
In response to the Home Office notice, last week Apple pulled its top level privacy tool, Advanced Data Protection, from the UK market.
Advanced Data Protection (ADP) means only account holders can view items such as photos or documents they have stored online through a process known as end-to-end encryption.
Apple would have to break its encryption systems in order to comply with the UK government demand, as currently it cannot see data protected in this way so would be unable to share it with law enforcement. This is something it says it will never do.
Apple's UK users' data remains encrypted in the UK but at a level which means it can be accessed by the tech giant if served with a warrant.
In the letter to Senator Ron Wyden and Representative Andy Biggs which has now been published online, Tulsi Gabbard said she first read about the notice in the media and had not been informed beforehand by either the UK or by Apple.
Apple did not comment. The Home Office referred the BBC to comments made earlier this week by security minister Dan Jarvis.
The Minister of State for Security said: ""I cannot comment on operational matters, and it would not be appropriate for me either to confirm or to deny the existence of any notices under the Investigatory Powers Act 2016.""
He added: ""What I can say is that the suggestion that privacy and security are at odds is not correct; we can and must have both.""
Meanwhile, two US lawmakers have also requested the US Department of Justice (DOJ) review the UK government's notice to Apple and its implications.
US Senator Alex Padilla and Representative Zoe Lofgren, two Democrats who both represent California, asked the DOJ to investigate whether the UK might have breached the terms of the US-UK Agreement on Access to Electronic Data for the Purpose of Countering Serious Crime.
""It is difficult to see the UK's notice to Apple, if the reports are accurate, as anything less than an action that undermines US law, public policy, and information security by requiring US companies to take such reckless action as undermining encryption for all users globally,"" the lawmakers said in a statement.

Nvidia says AI chip sales strong despite DeepSeek fears,"Nvidia, the chip giant at the heart of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, said its business remained strong, despite fears of a bubble stirred by the emergence of Chinese AI firm DeepSeek last month.
Sales of the firm's chips hit more than $39bn (£30.7bn) over the three months ended 27 January, up 74% year-on-year.
Nvidia has seen a surge of demand, as big tech companies turn to the firm for chips that can handle the large amounts of data used to train AI models.
But DeepSeek said it had trained its chatbot using less advanced, and less expensive chips.
Its launch prompted a sharp sell-off in Nvidia shares earlier this month, a hit felt throughout the market.
Investors calmed after big companies such as Facebook owner Meta said they expected to continue their current AI investment strategies.
Nvidia boss Jensen Huang said he was not worried that demand would suddenly shift, saying that software in the future would be created by machine learning that needs chips with different architecture than the ""hand-coding"" of the past.
""We know fundamentally software has changed,"" he said, adding that it was also still ""early days"" for the use of AI to spread.
Nvidia currently dominates the market in advanced chips, making it central to the boom in AI investment at companies such as Microsoft.
Its shares have surged more than 400% over the last two years, giving the company a market value of more than $3tn.
Nvidia said it was focused on rapidly building out production of its latest chips, known as Blackwell, which helped to drive a surge in the firm's revenue.
The company's finance chief Collette Kress said its AI data centre business was strongest in the US, but the firm was also seeing demand grow in other parts of the world, pointing to investments by France and the European Union.
She said demand in China - where US trade controls have blocked the firm from exporting certain chips - remained lower and that the firm expected shipments to remain roughly at the current level.",0

Alexa relaunched with ambition to be 'your best digital friend',"Amazon has unveiled Alexa+, an overhauled version of its virtual assistant with which it hopes users will share ""just about anything"".
Rapid recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI) have caused huge growth in software capable of natural-sounding conversations, with ChatGPT and DeepSeek among the most-downloaded apps worldwide.
Amazon is attempting to tap into this, with Alexa+ telling a launch event in New York it wanted to be ""your new best friend in the digital world"".
It will be included for free in Prime subscriptions when it launches from March - but to non-members it will cost $19.99 (£16) per month, with the UK price yet to be announced.
However experts have suggested consumers may struggle to get past their limited expectations of Amazon devices.
""Smart speakers are found in one in four UK homes, yet many users treat them as nothing more than expensive kitchen timers,"" said Ed Freed from marketing agency Rapp UK.
""Ultimately, the most logical place for a truly personal AI assistant is on your phone, not on your countertop.""
Amazon's head of devices and services Panos Panay said Alexa+ would remember information, meaning if you tell it you're a gluten intolerant vegan, for example, future recipes it suggested would bear this in mind.
And he promised there would be ""no more Alexa speak"" - meaning users will be able to speak to it more conversationally than previously possible.
These are new features that Dr Richard Whittle of University of Salford's Business School explained were ""long overdue"".
""Amazon is hoping its upgraded Alexa will challenge Copilot, Google Assistant and Siri, all of whom use new LLM (large language model) technology,"" he said.
""When users can now chat naturally to their AI assistants, Alexa's once leading voice interaction seems narrow and rigid.""
His colleague Dr Gordon Fletcher, associate dean of research and innovation, agreed.
""Technology changes more rapidly now, competing AI models get updated and everyone else scrambles to respond, Grok last week, Claude this week,"" he said.
""Alexa and the Echo hardware have increasingly seemed like an ageing relic, slow to shift and always behind the curve.""
Amazon told the BBC Alexa+ would be available in all countries which currently have Alexa.
In the US, it will be available from March, with other countries getting it later in 2025.
It will be available on devices as far back as the second generation Echo Dot, which launched in 2017.
For its devices with screens, it will be available as far back as the first generation Echo Show 8, which launched in 2019.
It is clear that Amazon expects Alexa+ to do more than its predecessor - and know much more about its users' lives.
Mara Segal, director of Alexa, said people will now be able to share ""just about anything"" with the virtual assistant - the idea being that by sharing emails and photographs, it will be able to search through them for things you request.
Other demonstrations included using it to book a taxi and a dinner reservation at a restaurant.
Thomas Husson, principal analyst at Forrester, said the relaunch was a tacit admission by Amazon that its original vision for smart speakers had failed.
""By subsidising hundreds of millions of Echo connected speakers, Alexa managed to enter households in the hope of generating incremental e-commerce sales,"" he said.
""This strategy failed and the company invested $25 billion (£20bn) in its Alexa division, without truly revolutionizing smart homes.""
He said it was ""about time"" Amazon created a ""truly smart and useful assistant"".
But he warned that to ""truly differentiate"" itself, Alexa would need to distinguish between personal and household data, which ""equals a big privacy and trust hurdle"".
And Dr Stuart Millar, lead AI engineer at Rapid7, said the move ""makes sense"" as Alexa has ""lagged behind"" competitors such as ChatGPT - but warned the real test will be when regular people get their hands on it.
""We've seen big tech companies launch ambitious AI features before, only to backtrack when unexpected issues arise, or it hasn't behaved as expected,"" he said.",0
Crypto sleuths join hunt for $1.5bn stolen in biggest ever heist,"A company which fell victim to what's thought to be the world's biggest ever theft is seeking to recover some of its losses by crowdsourcing online bounty hunters.
Last week, hackers believed to be from North Korea's notorious Lazarus Group stole $1.46bn (£1.1bn) of cryptocurrency from ByBit, a crypto trading platform.
The criminals are trying to rapidly cash out the hoard through a complex online money laundering process.
ByBit is now offering cash rewards to anyone who spots and prevents them from cashing out.
""Join us on war against Lazarus"" the company's CEO Ben Zhou posted online with a link to a new website offering a bounty to anyone who can help.
Cryptocurrencies are stored in public wallets anyone can look up so it's possible to follow the money as the criminals split it into smaller chunks and send it through various channels to obscure its origins.
The new website has a live leader board showing companies and individuals who have successfully located some of the coins.
The bounty scheme gives 5% of the sum identified to individuals who successfully persuade a company that has control of the funds to freeze the money.
It's also awarding 5% to the companies that take action.
The website is already displaying millions of dollars in payments to successful crypto sleuths.
""We have assigned a team to dedicate to maintain and update this website, we will not stop until Lazarus or bad actors in the industry is eliminated,"" Mr Zhou said.
Crypto investigation firm Elliptic described it as a ""really positive innovation.""
""There are a lot of very talented blockchain investigators out there who will now be motivated to track down these stolen funds, and to help to seize them,"" said Tom Robinson, from Elliptic.
However Louise Abbott, crypto fraud partner at Keystone Law, suggested the heist would still ""negatively impact the perception of trust"" in what she said was already a ""volatile"" industry.
""If such a hack can occur on this scale in the world's second largest exchange, it can certainly happen again,"" she said.
There are no authorities such as central banks or regulators involved in crypto transactions which means anyone who falls victim to criminal behaviour does not have an obvious body to turn to for help.
That's left ByBit reliant on the goodwill of other crypto companies to act on their behalf.
Not all have.
ByBit's website is keeping track of crypto firms that don't respond to requests for help.
One exchange called eXch is apparently refusing to cooperate.
According to researchers at crypto investigators Elliptic, eXch is a platform notable for allowing its users to swap cryptoassets anonymously.
In a blog post Elliptic alleges that ""hundreds of millions of dollars in cryptoassets derived from criminal activity, including multiple thefts perpetrated by North Korea"" have been successfully laundered through the service.
So far $75m from the ByBit hack has been tracked flowing through the website, according to analysis.
EXch has not responded to BBC requests for comment.
ByBit is promising to open up it's new bounty website to other victims of the prolific North Korean hacking group.
The site has a logo of North Korean leader Kim Jong Un's hair with a knife through it.
Crypto investigators around the world have attributed the hack to the group which has been blamed for around $6bn of crypto thefts in recent years.
Researchers say the stolen funds are used by the hermit state to skirt international sanctions and develop its military powers.
North Korea has never admitted to being responsible for the Lazarus Group.",0
Seven planets to be visible in night sky for last time until 2040,"Skywatchers are in for a treat this week as seven planets - Mars, Jupiter, Uranus, Venus, Neptune, Mercury, and Saturn will all be briefly visible in the evening sky.
This phenomenon, known as a 'planetary parade' is a rare sight, and it will be the last time seven planets can be seen simultaneously so well until 2040.
The best chance to see as many planets as possible will be just after sunset on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday.
Four of the planets - Mercury, Venus, Jupiter, and Mars - will be visible to the naked eye. Saturn will be harder to see because it will be low in the horizon. You will need a telescope to spot the other two planets - Uranus and Neptune.
A good view of the horizon and clear skies will offer the best chance of spotting them all. However, the window to see all seven planets will be very brief.
Dr Edward Bloomer, astronomer at the Royal Observatory Greenwich said: ""There's a rare opportunity to have seven planets in essentially a convenient place for you to look for them.""
As the sun sets, Saturn and Mercury will also be setting, making them particularly difficult to see.
""You really only have a few minutes after sunset to catch them before they drop below the horizon. After that, you'll still be able to see Venus, Jupiter, and Mars clearly for a much longer time,"" Dr Bloomer added.
The planets in our solar system orbit the Sun within roughly the same flat plane as the Earth.
As they orbit at different speeds and distances from the Sun, there are moments when they appear to line up from Earth's perspective creating a spectacular visual display, although the planets remain separated by vast distances in space.
Venus and Jupiter will be the easiest to spot due to their brightness, while Mars will have a distinct reddish hue.
""Uranus is technically visible with the naked eye, but you'd need perfect eyesight and ideal conditions,"" Dr Bloomer explains.
To improve your chances of seeing as many planets as possible, Dr Bloomer advises heading to a location with a clear view of the horizon and minimal light pollution.
""If you just pop out of your kitchen into your back garden, you will take time to adjust to the light levels. Give it a bit of time - your eyes take about half an hour to fully adjust,"" said Dr Bloomer.
""Avoid looking at your phone, get comfortable, and ensure you have an unobstructed view of the horizon.""
While this is an exciting opportunity, Dr Bloomer encourages people to make a habit of gazing at the night sky.
""See how things change,"" he said, adding that observing the heavens is ""a chance to witness the ongoing mechanics of the solar system at work.""

On Wednesday night, skies will be generally cloudier with showery rain at times.
By Thursday, expect a drier, clearer view of the night sky. Earlier in the evening is best, as mist and fog patches may develop further into the night.
For Friday high pressure is expected to dominate, keeping dry conditions for most with clear spells. Soon after sunset is most favoured as mist and fog patches may develop later.

BBC review finds 'serious flaws' over Gaza documentary,"The BBC has apologised and admitted ""serious flaws"" in the making of a documentary about children's lives in Gaza.
The documentary, Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone, was pulled from iPlayer last week after it emerged its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.
It said it has ""no plans to broadcast the programme again in its current form or return it to iPlayer"".
Hoyo Films, the production company that made the documentary for the BBC, said it felt it was ""important to hear from voices that haven't been represented onscreen throughout the war with dignity and respect"".
The company added it was ""cooperating fully"" with the BBC to ""help understand where mistakes have been made"".
The BBC removed the documentary after concerns were raised that it centred on a boy called Abdullah who is the son of Hamas's deputy minister of agriculture. Hamas is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UK and others.
It also launched a review into the film, and the BBC's Board met earlier on Thursday to discuss it.
In the statement, a BBC spokesperson said both the production company and the BBC had made ""unacceptable"" flaws and that it ""takes full responsibility for these and the impact that these have had on the corporation's reputation"".
It added the BBC had not been informed of the teenager's family connection in advance by the film's production company.
The spokesperson says: ""During the production process, the independent production company was asked in writing a number of times by the BBC about any potential connections he and his family might have with Hamas.
""Since transmission, they have acknowledged that they knew that the boy's father was a deputy agriculture minister in the Hamas government; they have also acknowledged that they never told the BBC this fact.
""It was then the BBC's own failing that we did not uncover that fact and the documentary was aired.""
Hoyo Films have told the corporation that they paid the young boy's mother ""a limited sum of money"" for narrating the film via his sister's bank account, the BBC statement added.
It said Hoyo assured the BBC that no payments were made to any members of Hamas or its affiliates ""either directly, in kind or as a gift"", and that it is seeking ""additional assurance"" around the programme's budget.
In its statement, Hoyo added: ""We feel this remains an important story to tell, and that our contributors – who have no say in the war – should have their voices heard"".
A full audit of the expenditure on the film will be undertaken by the BBC, and it will be asking for the relevant financial accounts of Hoyo Films so this can be carried out.
The BBC spokesperson said the incident had ""damaged"" the trust in the Corporation's journalism - and ""the processes and execution of this programme fell short of our expectations"".
They added the director-general of the BBC had asked for complaints to be expedited to the Executive Complaints Unit, ""which is separate from BBC News"".
A separate statement from the BBC Board added: ""The subject matter of the documentary was clearly a legitimate area to explore, but nothing is more important than trust and transparency in our journalism. While the Board appreciates that mistakes can be made, the mistakes here are significant and damaging to the BBC.""
Prime Minister Keir Starmer was asked about the film during a press conference with US President Donald Trump on Thursday, saying he had been ""concerned"" about it, adding that ""the secretary of state has had a meeting with the BBC"".
Earlier this week, the BBC was criticised for pulling the programme by more than 500 media figures, including Gary Lineker, Anita Rani and Riz Ahmed.",0
Japan's MeToo icon is up for an Oscar - but the film can't air in the country,"When Japanese journalist Shiori Ito decided to speak up about her rape allegations, she knew she was standing in the face of a society that preferred silence.
""I'm scared…but all I want to do is to talk about the truth"", Shiori says in the opening scene of her Oscar-nominated documentary Black Box Diaries.
Shiori became the face of Japan's MeToo movement after she accused a prominent journalist Noriyuki Yamaguchi of rape.
Her acclaimed directorial debut, based on her memoir of the same name, is a retelling of her quest for justice after authorities found the evidence insufficient to pursue criminal charges.
But there is one country where it is yet to play: Japan, where it has run into huge controversy. Her former lawyers have accused her of including audio and video footage she did not have permission to use, which, they say, has violated trust and put her sources at risk. Shiori defends what she did as necessary for ""public good"".
It's a startling turn in a story that gripped Japan when it first broke -the then 28-year-old Shiori ignored her family's request to remain silent. And after her public accusation did not result in a criminal case, she filed a civil lawsuit against Yamaguchi and won $30,000 (£22,917) in damages.
Shiori told the BBC making the film involved ""reliving her trauma"": ""It took me four years [to make the film] because emotionally I was struggling.""
She was an intern at Reuters news agency in 2015, when she says Yamaguchi invited her to discuss a job opportunity. He was the Washington bureau chief for a major Japanese media firm, Tokyo Broadcasting System.
Shiori claims she was raped following a dinner in Tokyo with Yamaguchi, who has always denied the allegations.
CCTV footage of an intoxicated Shiori being dragged from a taxi and into a hotel is part of the more than 400 hours of footage she edited for the documentary.
The editing process, she says, was ""really challenging. It was like hardcore exposure therapy.""
When the film was released, the CCTV footage became a source of friction as Shiori's team of ex-lawyers, who helped her win her lawsuit, slammed the documentary.
They claimed it was unauthorised use of CCTV footage - and that she had violated a pledge not to use it outside of court proceedings. .
Last week, her former lawyers – led by Yoko Nishihiro - held another press conference, saying her use of the footage posed challenges for other sexual assault cases.
""If the fact that the evidence from the trial has been made public is known, we will be unable to obtain cooperation in future cases,"" Ms Nishihiro said.
Ms Nishihiro claimed that Shiori had also used unauthorised recordings, saying she only found this out at a screening of the film last July.
This included audio of a police detective who eventually acted as a whistleblower about the investigation process – as well as a video of a taxi driver who provided testimony about the night of the alleged rape. Both of them, the lawyers argued, were identifiable and neither had given their consent to be featured in the film.
""I've been trying so hard to protect her for eight-and-half years, and I feel like I've been completely torn apart,"" Ms Nishihiro said.
""I want her to explain and be held accountable.""
Shiori had earlier acknowledged that she did not have the hotel's permission to use the CCTV but argued that this was ""the only visual evidence"" she had of the night she was sexually assaulted.
She added that including audio of the police detective was necessary because of ""the cover up of the investigation"", adding that she was releasing the video ""for the public good"".
""We are standing in different points of view,"" she said of the fallout with her former lawyers.
""For me, [it's for the] public good. For them, it's 'do not break any rules'.""
There has been no official explanation as to why the film has not yet been distributed. Shiori has said that ""Japan is still not ready to talk about [it]"", but its unclear how much of it is also due to legal hurdles.
In her latest statement last week, Shiori apologised and said she would re-edit parts of the documentary to make sure individuals would not be identified, adding that a redacted version would be screened moving forward.
""There are moments I wish I didn't have to put in [the documentary]. There are moments I'm not proud of but I wanted to put all of it and to show we are also human,"" she told the BBC. ""No-one is perfect.""
In the nine years since the assault, Shiori's fight against Japan's justice system has been well-chronicled in the media - and is something she says she wanted to detail in her documentary.
She was met with a wave of backlash when she went public in 2017, receiving hate mail and online abuse.
""People were telling me you're not crying enough… you're not wearing proper clothes... you're too strong.""
Some criticised the way she was dressed at the press conference where she first accused Yamaguchi – they said her shirt had been buttoned too low down. Shiori said she left Japan for a few months, fearing for her safety.
Shiori's case was followed by other high-profile cases. In 2023, former soldier Rina Gonoi also went public with her story, accusing three ex-soldiers of sexually assaulting her. This was the year Japan passed landmark laws to redefine rape from ""forcible sexual intercourse"" to ""non-consensual sexual intercourse"" and raised the age of consent from 13 to 16.
Gonoi eventually won her case but Shiori says it is proof that speaking up against sexual violence comes at a price, adding: ""Is it worth going through this as a survivor seeking justice? It shouldn't be this way. You have to sacrifice a lot.""
For now it's unclear if her film will ever be screened in Japan, but she says that its homecoming would be her ultimate prize.
""This is my love letter to Japan. I really wish one day I can screen my film, and my family can also watch it,"" she added.
""That's what I really hope for… more than winning an Oscar.""",0

They claimed it was unauthorised use of CCTV footage - and that she had violated a pledge not to use it outside of court proceedings. .
Last week, her former lawyers – led by Yoko Nishihiro - held another press conference, saying her use of the footage posed challenges for other sexual assault cases.
""If the fact that the evidence from the trial has been made public is known, we will be unable to obtain cooperation in future cases,"" Ms Nishihiro said.
Ms Nishihiro claimed that Shiori had also used unauthorised recordings, saying she only found this out at a screening of the film last July.
This included audio of a police detective who eventually acted as a whistleblower about the investigation process – as well as a video of a taxi driver who provided testimony about the night of the alleged rape. Both of them, the lawyers argued, were identifiable and neither had given their consent to be featured in the film.
""I've been trying so hard to protect her for eight-and-half years, and I feel like I've been completely torn apart,"" Ms Nishihiro said.
""I want her to explain and be held accountable.""
Shiori had earlier acknowledged that she did not have the hotel's permission to use the CCTV but argued that this was ""the only visual evidence"" she had of the night she was sexually assaulted.
She added that including audio of the police detective was necessary because of ""the cover up of the investigation"", adding that she was releasing the video ""for the public good"".
""We are standing in different points of view,"" she said of the fallout with her former lawyers.
""For me, [it's for the] public good. For them, it's 'do not break any rules'.""
There has been no official explanation as to why the film has not yet been distributed. Shiori has said that ""Japan is still not ready to talk about [it]"", but its unclear how much of it is also due to legal hurdles.
In her latest statement last week, Shiori apologised and said she would re-edit parts of the documentary to make sure individuals would not be identified, adding that a redacted version would be screened moving forward.
""There are moments I wish I didn't have to put in [the documentary]. There are moments I'm not proud of but I wanted to put all of it and to show we are also human,"" she told the BBC. ""No-one is perfect.""
In the nine years since the assault, Shiori's fight against Japan's justice system has been well-chronicled in the media - and is something she says she wanted to detail in her documentary.
She was met with a wave of backlash when she went public in 2017, receiving hate mail and online abuse.
""People were telling me you're not crying enough… you're not wearing proper clothes... you're too strong.""
Some criticised the way she was dressed at the press conference where she first accused Yamaguchi – they said her shirt had been buttoned too low down. Shiori said she left Japan for a few months, fearing for her safety.
Shiori's case was followed by other high-profile cases. In 2023, former soldier Rina Gonoi also went public with her story, accusing three ex-soldiers of sexually assaulting her. This was the year Japan passed landmark laws to redefine rape from ""forcible sexual intercourse"" to ""non-consensual sexual intercourse"" and raised the age of consent from 13 to 16.
Gonoi eventually won her case but Shiori says it is proof that speaking up against sexual violence comes at a price, adding: ""Is it worth going through this as a survivor seeking justice? It shouldn't be this way. You have to sacrifice a lot.""
For now it's unclear if her film will ever be screened in Japan, but she says that its homecoming would be her ultimate prize.
""This is my love letter to Japan. I really wish one day I can screen my film, and my family can also watch it,"" she added.
""That's what I really hope for… more than winning an Oscar.""",0
'Leave it to the imagination': Normal People star says no need for a sequel,"Normal People actor Éanna Hardwicke has said he doesn't want a sequel to the hit TV series, as he's ""not a fan of rehashing things"".
""It's nicer to leave it in people's imagination, and leave it as it was,"" the 28-year-old told BBC News at a pre-Oscars party in Los Angeles on Thursday night.
Based on Sally Rooney's novel, the BBC Three drama charted the on-off relationship of teenagers Marianne and Connell.
It starred Daisy Edgar Jones and Paul Mescal, while Hardwicke played Rob, Connell's friend from high school.
Released in April 2020, Normal People became a lockdown phenomenon.
Last year, Edgar-Jones and Mescal almost broke the internet with an Instagram post that appeared to tease a sequel.
The pair later clarified that, in fact, they were reuniting to host a marathon screening of Normal People for charity.
There are spoilers below.
In the series, Hardwicke's character Rob suffers from depression and commits suicide, causing Connell's mental health to suffer.
But Hardwicke said that it's not the fact he wouldn't be in any sequel, that makes him not want one.
""I'd be very happy to watch it as a punter, because then I could enjoy it,"" he said, speaking at the annual Oscar Wilde event to celebrate Irish talent.
He also admitted that he can why some people want to revisit the series.
""Of course, part of me is curious, I'd love to see those characters in 15 years,"" he said.
""I just adore Sally [Rooney]'s writing so much, I'm excited every time she releases a new book, so I'm just looking forward to reading what she does next.""
Hardwicke said he still speaks to his Normal People co-stars.
""We all stay in touch, which is nice. It was a really special thing for all of us,"" he said.
""I think that will never change. It will always be a really foundational job for all of us, so we do stay in touch.
""Every now and then we meet for a pint and go, 'God, wasn't that mad'.""
More recently, Hardwicke starred as murderer Benjamin Field in BBC One true crime drama The Sixth Commandment.
The series follows the murders of Peter Farquhar and Ann Moore-Martin in Maids Moreton, Buckinghamshire.
Hardwicke said he didn't have an answer for why people are so fascinated by true crime, but said as an actor, ""you just want to work on stuff that has that depth"".
""There's a responsibility to telling true stories, to know why you're doing it, why you're telling the story, what's the point,"" he said.
""It was approaching true stories in a different way. I felt, when I read that script, it was doing it with scrutiny and care and it didn't feel at all manipulative.""",0
Japanese woman under investigation for kissing BTS's Jin,"A Japanese woman who unexpectedly kissed K-pop boy band BTS's Jin at a fan event last year has found herself under investigation by South Korean police.
South Korean police have called for the woman - who is currently in Japan - to come forward for questioning on charges of sexual harrassment in a public space.
The incident happened during the K-pop idol's first public event in Seoul last June which saw him hug 1,000 fans. Instead of just hugging the star, the woman appeared to have kissed his face, with Jin responding by turning his face away.
The kiss angered other BTS fans, one of whom filed a criminal complaint against her, leading police to launch an investigation.
On 13 June, 2024, the day after he was discharged from the army, Jin, whose real name is Kim Seok-jin, held a fan event where he hugged 1,000 fans and performed songs in front of 3,000 others.
During the three-hour long ""hugathon"", fans who won the chance to embrace him queued up and went on stage one by one to meet the 33-year-old star.
But one of them caused an uproar when she appeared to kiss Jin's face.
Clips of the moment went viral on the internet. Videos show that Jin, taken aback by the move, tried to turn his head while hugging the woman before quickly moving on to the next fan. Fans could also be seen reacting angrily to her actions.
She later wrote on her blog later that she kissed him ""on his neck"" and ""the skin was very soft"".
The woman's identity has not been revealed but police added that they had identified her with the assistance from their Japanese counterparts.
The BBC has reached out to BTS' agency HYBE for comment.
Jin is the first BTS member to have been discharged from military duty. He was followed by J-Hope who was discharged in October. The other four - V, RM, Jimin, Jungkook and Suga - are still serving and the band is expected to reunite only in June 2025.
K-pop idols are known for having a close relationship with their fanbases through various communication channels and events. It's common for artists to communicate with fans through social media livestream chats and in-person events to cultivate loyal fans.
But fans and agencies have increasingly been aware of some toxic fan cultures as well. For example, many artists have been vocal about the stress caused by ""sasaeng fans"", who are overly obsessed with their idols that would stalk and harass the artists.",0
"Death of Hackman and wife 'suspicious enough' for investigation, police say","Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman and his wife appeared to have been dead for ""quite a while"" when the couple and their dog were found on Wednesday afternoon at their home in the US state of New Mexico, police say.
Hackman, 95, was discovered in a side room near the kitchen of the house in Santa Fe, while his wife Betsy Arakawa, a 65-year-old classical pianist, was found in a bathroom.
Authorities reported no signs of injury but deemed the deaths ""suspicious enough"" to investigate and have not ruled out foul play. No cause of death was given.
In a wide-ranging career, Hackman won two Academy Awards for The French Connection and Unforgiven.
Three of Hackman's children from a previous marriage confirmed the death of their father and Ms Arakawa in a statement to the BBC.
""He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us he was always just Dad and Grandpa. We will miss him sorely and are devastated by the loss,"" Elizabeth, Leslie and Annie Hackman said.
Warning: This story contains details some readers may find upsetting
The Santa Fe County Sheriff's office confirmed the deaths.
""On 26 February, 2025, at approximately 1:45pm, Santa Fe County Sheriff's deputies were dispatched to an address on Old Sunset Trail in Hyde Park where Gene Hackman, his wife Betsy Arakawa, and a dog were found deceased,"" the office said.
In a news conference on Thursday afternoon, Sheriff Adan Mendoza said: ""It sounds like they had been deceased for quite a while, and I don't want to guess in reference to how long that was.""
He added: ""There was no immediate sign of foul play. Haven't ruled that out yet.
""This is an investigation, so we're keeping everything on the table.""
A sheriff's detective who responded to the scene said that they believed the couple had been dead for some time because of Ms Arakawa's ""decomposition"" and ""mummification"" in the hands and feet.
""The male decedent also showed obvious signs of death, similar and consistent with the female decedent,"" said the search warrant.
Near Ms Arakawa's head was a portable heater, which the detective determined could have been brought down in the event that she abruptly fell to the ground.
Authorities say they have requested carbon monoxide and toxicology tests for both Hackman and his wife, and that a cause of death has not yet been determined as they await the results of the autopsy.
A prescription bottle and scattered pills were on the bathroom countertop close to her body. The couple's German Shepherd dog was found dead in a bathroom closet near to Ms Arakawa.
Hackman was discovered wearing grey tracksuit bottoms, a blue long-sleeve T-shirt and brown slippers. Sunglasses and a walking cane were next to the body.
The detective suspected that the actor had fallen suddenly.
The circumstances of their death were ""suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation"", said the search warrant, because the person who called emergency services found the front door of the property open.
But the detective observed no sign of forced entry into the home. Nothing appeared out of place inside. Neither was there any indication that belongings had been rummaged through, or that any items had been removed.
Two other, healthy dogs were discovered roaming the property - one inside and one outside.
The couple's 2,300 sq ft ranch-style home, part of a gated community, was valued at around $1m, according to tax records.
The local utility responded and found no sign of a gas leak in the area. The fire department detected no indication of a carbon monoxide leak or poisoning, according to the search warrant.
The detective spoke at the scene to two maintenance workers, one of whom had called the emergency services.
The two workers said they sometimes conducted routine work at the property, but rarely ever saw the couple.
They indicated that they communicated with them by phone and text, primarily with Ms Arakawa.
The two workers said they last had contact with the couple two weeks beforehand.
A recording of the 911 call obtained by the BBC shows the emotional caller telling a dispatcher how he found the two bodies.
""No, they're not moving,"" he says in the audio. ""Just send somebody out here really quick.""
The person, who made the call while standing outside the property and peering in through a window, is heard saying ""damn"" repeatedly.
Hackman met Ms Arakawa when she was working part-time at a California gym in the mid-1980s, the New York Times has previously reported.
He won the best actor Oscar for his role as Jimmy ""Popeye"" Doyle in William Friedkin's 1971 thriller The French Connection, and another for best supporting actor for playing Little Bill Daggett in Clint Eastwood's Western film Unforgiven in 1992.
A relative latecomer to Hollywood, Hackman's breathrough came in his thirties, when he was nominated for an Oscar for portraying Buck Barrow in 1967's Bonnie and Clyde - opposite Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway - and again for I Never Sang for My Father in 1970.
Both films saw him recognised in the supporting actor category. He was also nominated for best leading actor in 1988 for playing the FBI agent in Mississippi Burning.
He played more than 100 roles during his career, including supervillain Lex Luthor in the Christopher Reeve-starring Superman movies in the 1970s and 1980s.
Hackman featured opposite many other Hollywood heavyweights including Al Pacino in 1973's Scarecrow and Gene Wilder in 1974's Young Frankenstein.
His last big-screen appearance came as Monroe Cole in Welcome to Mooseport in 2004, after which he stepped back from Hollywood for a quieter life in New Mexico.",0

Daleks and Cybermen sold for Children in Need,"An auction of Doctor Who props and costumes raised £245,243 for Children in Need.
Auctioneer Propstore, based in Chenies, Buckinghamshire, said more than 2,000 global fans and collectors bid on more than 170 lots.
The biggest earner was a Dalek - used on screen for actress Jodie Whittaker's final episode as the doctor - which sold for £16,380.
Stephen Lane, founder and chief executive of Propstore, was delighted and said: ""From Doctors to Daleks, the dedication and passion of Doctor Who fans supporting this auction has been second to none.""
A TARDIS prop used in a biographical film about the creation of Doctor Who, called An Adventure in Space and Time, sold for £12,600.
Parts of a Cyberman costume, from one of actor Peter Capaldi's last stories, fetched £15,120.

"Pamela Anderson on missing out on Oscars, ditching makeup and 'innocence' of Baywatch","Pamela Anderson has had her fair share of ups and down over her career.
So that might explain why she's so stoic about missing out on an Oscar nomination for her role in The Last Showgirl.
“The win is the work,” the Canadian actress told BBC News.
“You couldn't have told me I'd be here a decade ago, so this is very exciting for me, to even be in the conversation.”
Anderson, 57, did manage to score nominations at the Golden Globes and Screen Actors Guild Awards for her part in Gia Coppola’s film about a fading Las Vegas dancer.
But she is not in the running for the Academy Awards, which take place this Sunday in Los Angeles.
“I just wish everybody well,” she said.
“I think anybody, any actor, realises that all of this is about having another chance to be able to perform and share your talent with the world.”
Anderson rose to prominence on the 1990s TV series Baywatch.
The lifeguard drama became the most-watched television show in the world at the time, and it's still the role she's best known for.
But in the three decades since she first ran along the California beaches, fans and critics have become acquainted with different parts of Anderson's life story including Playboy covers, a leaked sex tape and many marriages.
In 2022, Hulu series Pam & Tommy told the story of how Anderson and now ex-husband Tommy Lee's sex tape was stolen and illegally distributed in the mid-90s.
Anderson later criticised the series in an interview with Variety, describing it as ""shocking"" and calling for the people behind it to apologise to her.
Now, she's starring in a new film which is also about second chances.
In The Last Showgirl, the lead character Shelly, played by Anderson, must plan for her future after her show abruptly closes.
Plenty of critics have drawn parallels with Anderson’s own life in the spotlight, and she doesn't dispute this.
“I think that’s what drew me to the project, that it was so relatable on so many levels,” Anderson said of the film.
She added that its central theme, of struggling to make your career work as a woman in later middle age, was something ""many generations of women"" had faced.
In the film, Shelly is portrayed as having a strained relationship with her daughter Hannah.
Shelly's career as a showgirl means she often works late, causing her to miss important moments like bedtime with Hannah.
That, too, is something that Anderson says she can relate to.
She shares two sons, Brandon Thomas, 28, and Dylan Jagger, 27, with her ex-husband, Mötley Crüe drummer Tommy Lee.
She said that for all working mums, there's ""no proper way"" to be a parent while also following your dreams and pursuing your career.
“So this movie is, I think, in a very vulnerable space.
“And it was an interesting role to play with all her imperfections and selfishness and selflessness. And it was a lot of layers and nuances to the character that I could really relate to.”
The Last Showgirl has received a mixed reception from critics, though most have praised Anderson's performance.
The New York Times called it ""sensitive and beguiling"" and described Anderson as ""dazzling"". But the Guardian awarded it just one star, calling it ""a big disappointment"" (although a later review bumped that up to three stars).
Many have also described the role as Anderson's ""comeback"". She doesn't reject the term, but says she prefers to see it as ""a new chapter"".
""I've always been fascinated with the craft of acting,"" she said. ""[But] my personal life kind of took me off course, and I raised two beautiful boys.""
She's not the only actress to be back in the spotlight this season.
Demi Moore is nominated for best actress at the Oscars for her role in The Substance, a body horror which has revitalised her career.
""I'm really happy for Demi,"" Anderson said. ""I think she's earned her place. And you have to earn it. You have to fight for it.""
With so many strong female protagonists in this year's films, I'm curious what Anderson now thinks of Baywatch.
The show has long been criticised for its portrayal of its female characters, who, many argued, were sexualised and denied meaningful plot lines.
""I didn't see it like that at all. I thought it was quite innocent and wholesome and, and fun to watch,"" she said.
""I always felt like I was surrounded by such incredible people, lifeguards that were also firemen or firewomen. It was really, really, empowering.""
Anderson has always been seen to embody a look that rose to prominence in the 90s - skinny, blonde, and enhanced by plastic surgery.
But in recent years, she has been sporting a ""no-makeup"" look, choosing instead to embrace her natural appearance.
""My beauty routine is rest. And so that's more important to me these days,"" she told me.
She said it's not that she's against makeup, but more that she thinks ""there's a time and a place"" for it.
""This chapter, for me, has been about self-acceptance and finding out who I am. What are my original thoughts? What do I have to give?"" she said.
""I know I have a lot more to give in this world, in this industry too, and I feel like even I have to remember who I am to start with and then hopefully, play characters in films and not in my personal life.""",0
Gene Hackman's daughters and Clint Eastwood lead tributes to star,"Gene Hackman's daughters and granddaughter say they are ""devastated"" and will ""miss him sorely"", as they led tributes to the movie star who has died aged 95.
Hackman was found dead along with his wife Betsy Arakawa and their dog at his home in New Mexico, US. No cause of death was given, but police said the situation was ""suspicious enough"" to merit investigation.
In a statement, daughters Elizabeth and Leslie, and granddaughter Annie said: ""He was loved and admired by millions around the world for his brilliant acting career, but to us he was always just dad and grandpa.""
Morgan Freeman who co-starred with Hackman in the 1992 movie Unforgiven - for which Hackman won an Oscar - described the actor as ""incredibly gifted"" while the movie's director Clint Eastwood said he was ""extremely saddened"" by the news.
Ralph Fiennes - nominated for an Oscar this year for Conclave - paid tribute to the late actor with a black and white portrait of a smiling Hackman, simply titled Gene Hackman 1930-2025.
Viola Davis called Hackman ""one of the greats"" while Tom Hanks posted on Instagram that: ""There has never been a 'Gene Hackman Type.' There has only been Gene Hackman.""
The Prince of Wales also issued a statement saying he was ""so sad to hear the news"".
""Hackman was a true genius of film who brought each and every character to life with power, authenticity and star quality,"" added Prince William, who is also president of Bafta.
Hackman's 1978 Superman co-star Valerie Perrine labelled him ""a genius"", while the Guardian's film critic said his death ""marks the end"" of the era of American new wave cinema.
The Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola, who worked with Hackman on the 1974 mystery thriller The Conversation, called Hackman ""a great artist"".
In a statement posted on Instagram, Coppola said: ""Gene Hackman a great actor, inspiring and magnificent in his work and complexity.
""I mourn his loss, and celebrate his existence and contribution.""
Hackman, who won two Oscars for his work on The French Connection and Clint Eastwood's Western Unforgiven, played more than 100 roles across his career.
They included supervillain Lex Luthor in the Christopher Reeve-starring Superman movies in the 1970s and 1980s.
Perrine, who acted opposite Hackman as his character's on-screen girlfriend Eve Teschmacher, described the late actor as ""a genius"" and one of the ""greatest to grace the silver screen"".
She posted on X: ""His performances are legendary. His talent will be missed. Goodbye my sweet Lex Till we meet again.""
Hackman appeared alongside Hollywood heavyweights including Al Pacino in 1973's Scarecrow, Gene Wilder in 1974's Young Frankenstein and Warren Beatty and Diane Keaton in 1981's Reds.
He also starred in the hit movies Runaway Jury and Wes Anderson's The Royal Tenenbaums.
The British Academy of Film and Television, said it was ""saddened"" to hear of Hackman's death, describing him as a ""much-celebrated"" actor with an ""illustrious"" career.
Spanish actor Antonio Banderas described it as being ""a very sad day for the cinema's family"".
Hank Azaria, the actor best known for voicing characters in The Simpsons, said ""it was an honour and an education working with Gene Hackman"" on 1996's The Birdcage.
""Mike Nichols said of his genius character acting: 'He always brought just enough of a different part of the real gene to each role he played.' Sending all my love to his family and friends.
Star Trek actor George Takei posted: ""We have lost one of the true giants of the screen.
""Gene Hackman could play anyone, and you could feel a whole life behind it,"" he wrote.
""He could be everyone and no-one, a towering presence or an everyday Joe. That's how powerful an actor he was. He will be missed, but his work will live on forever.""
Slumdog Millionaire star Anil Kapoor also called Hackman a ""genius"" performer. ""A true legend whose legacy will live on,"" he wrote.
As well as his Oscar wins, Hackman also collected two Baftas, four Golden Globes and a Screen Actors Guild Award.
The Guardian's film critic Pete Bradshaw wrote that Hackman's death ""marks the end of one of the greatest periods of US cinema: the American new wave.""
""Hackman was the gold standard for this era, ever since Warren Beatty gave him his big break with the role of Buck Barrow in Arthur Penn's Bonnie and Clyde (1967),"" said Bradshaw.
""He was the character actor who was really a star; in fact the star of every scene he was in – that tough, wised-up, intelligent but unhandsome face perpetually on the verge of coolly unconcerned derision, or creased in a heartbreakingly fatherly, pained smile.""
Adding: ""He wasn't gorgeous like [Robert] Redford or dangerously sexy like [Jack] Nicholson, or even puckish like [Dustin] Hoffman; Hackman was normal, but his normality was steroidally supercharged.""
The critic branded his performance ""as the reckless, racist cop"", 'Jimmy 'Popeye' Doyle, in William Friedkin's 1971 film The French Connection as ""unmissable"".",0

Eggheads star Chris Hughes dies aged 77,"Quizzer Chris Hughes, star of the popular BBC and Channel 5 series Eggheads, has died aged 77, a statement on the programme's social media accounts has said.
Hughes was one of several general knowledge experts who regularly appeared on the show, which saw members of the public take on the five so-called ""Eggheads"".
A statement posted on the show's Facebook and X accounts on Thursday, reported by the Press Association news agency, paid tribute to an ""Eggheads great"".
""It is with immense sadness that we announce the passing of Eggheads great Chris Hughes,"" it read.
""Chris joined the show in 2003 and over the next 20 years gave us not only brilliant answers but very many laughs and happy memories.""
It concluded: ""He will be hugely missed by all his Eggheads family.""
Hughes was born in Middlesex and attended Enfield Grammar School.
Before becoming known as one of the country's leading quizzers, he worked as a train driver and railway worker.
He went on to become a regular contributor on Eggheads - which began on BBC Two in 2003 before moving to Channel 5 in 2020.
The Eggheads panel was made up of general knowledge experts, including winners from others shows such as Mastermind, The Weakest Link and Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?.
In each episode, five Eggheads would compete with a team made up of five members of the public, who would play individually against a single Egghead in each round, before a final face-off between the remaining players of both sides.
If the amateurs were successful, they would take home a cash prize. The jackpot would increase by £1,000 per episode, with each edition's prize money rolling into the next day if the Eggheads won.
As a result of the Eggheads high level of expertise, many of the jackpots would reach a sizeable sum before finally being won. The highest ever jackpot reached £75,000, which was won by a team in 2007.
The series was presented by news presenter Dermot Murnaghan, before Radio 2 DJ and Channel 5 talk show host Jeremy Vine took over the role.
Hughes is one of only seven people to have won both Brain of Britain and Mastermind, and also scored a victory on International Mastermind.
Eggheads producer Robert Dean said on X: ""[Hughes] was an amazing Egghead who considered everyone on the production team part of his family.
""I have such fond memories of him and count myself lucky to have known him. I'll miss him tremendously.""
After having reached the final of another hit quiz show, The Weakest Link, without getting a single question wrong, host Anne Robinson declared Hughes to be ""the best contestant we have had on the Weakest Link"" and chose not to use her mean spirited signature catchphrase: ""you are the Weakest Link, goodbye!"".",0

Music director behind Lola Young's Messy surprised by success,"You might not know her name but chances are you've seen Sarah Dattani Tucker's work - more than 40 million have at least.
She's the creative director behind the video for Lola Young's Messy music video, the track that's earned the singer her first UK number one.
Shot on film, the visualiser shows Lola performing in a bare room with an enormous cake which, by the end, has been destroyed.
""The concept is inspired by intrusive thoughts,"" she says.
""The room is empty because it's supposed to represent a neutral space, like your head space.""
It was one of seven films Sarah made for the pop star to accompany tracks from her second album, This Wasn't Meant for You Anyway.
Sarah's also worked with Arlo Parks and says she never imagined she could do this kind of job, let alone reach this level of success.
Part of that, she says, is due to her Gujarati heritage.
""Sometimes people don't necessarily know where to place you,"" she tells BBC Newsbeat.
""As a South Asian in the music industry, I often feel really misunderstood.
""There's so few of us in the wider industry.""
Sarah was born and raised just outside of Manchester to a British dad and a Gujarati mum who was born in Uganda.
At school, Sarah says she loved art but was never shown how she might be able to turn that into a career.
""I did not come from a family of creatives,"" she says.
""I don't want to stereotype in any way, but I would say most of my family are like accountants or pharmacists.""
And while she says she was never discouraged from pursuing her passion, when she took her first steps in the industry ""family members definitely didn't fully understand exactly what my job was"".
""I definitely had to keep reminding everyone that this is a real job.""
Feeling misunderstood wasn't limited to school and family life though. Even now Sarah says she can feel out of place in the music industry.
""The music industry is so based on genre, and sometimes I've felt like people look at me and they're like, 'oh, you can't really work on this or that'.
""I've definitely really struggled with it. It's been really hard.""
The latest diversity report by UK Music recorded that in 2024, 7.6% of people working in the music industry identified as Asian.
The group represents all sectors of the industry and noted there had been ""positive movement in the right direction"", with people from minority backgrounds now representing more than 25% of the workforce - up from 15.6% when the survey started in 2016.
""Nonetheless barriers still exist and we must continue to seek change,"" the report said.
""There is a lot of misunderstanding and lack of acknowledgement sometimes,"" Sarah says.
And a lack of acknowledgement is something she'd like to address not just for British Asians, but the people working behind the scenes in the music industry too.
Lola Young is up for best pop act at Saturday's Brit Awards and, until 2019, music videos had a chance to be nominated for prizes too.
That award, British Video of the Year, no longer exists - it was last won by Little Mix for their Woman Like Me video.
Other big awards like the Grammys still make a point of celebrating music videos and even go one step further with an award for best recording package, which goes to the artistic director behind a project.
This year it was won by Charli XCX and her creative director Imogene Strauss for Brat, which took on a life of its own - even being named Collins Dictionary 2024 word of the year.
""That's such a special moment because that campaign and the creative behind it is incredible,"" Sarah says.
She'd like to see would like to see similar opportunities for recognition at the Brits.
""It would be nice to have that kind of recognition, just because it is such a big production.
""There's so many parts to a campaign, it's so multifaceted.""
The Brit Awards have not yet responded to Newsbeat's request for comment.

Is Young Spencer the Shankill's answer to Kneecap?,"On the other side of west Belfast's peace wall, Young Spencer is rapping about subjects similar to Kneecap.
Like them, he references drugs, paramilitaries and identity.
But - it's told from a totally different perspective to the famous (and infamous) Irish language hip-hop trio.
While Kneecap wrap themselves in the Irish tricolour, in one of his songs Young Spencer continually talks about the red, white and blue of the Union flag.
Yet recently they shared a stage in the city and thousands of Kneecap's fans sang along with a man who describes himself as proud to be British.
Speaking to BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme, the rapper said his appearance in front of the sold-out SSE Arena crowd was about bringing communities together based more than just their religion.
""At the end of the day, to me that was more so about the unification of the city,"" he said.
""Yes, you're from the Falls and I'm from the Shankill, but it's more so about this city that we come from.""
He said when the west Belfast rap trio first reached out about performing at their show in December there were nerves.
""There's just as much reason to say no as to say yes, and people would go 'why is that? It's the biggest opportunity of your life',"" he added.
""You are still driven with fear as much as you are driven with love, and you're still worried that people aren't receptive to where you're from and when you're talking about greatness and moving the city forward and the country forward as a whole.
""Maybe some people won't understand Kneecap and Young Spencer on the same stage until 20, 30 years' time, but that's ok because what's supposed to be understood will be understood.""
Young Spencer is the alter-ego of Gareth Spence, who during the day works in a school in Belfast.
He was raised on the Shankill Road, which he admits saw guns, drugs, paramilitaries and division during many troubled years in Northern Ireland.
But living there has been in his own words ""a gift"" as well as a curse.
Now 30 years old, he got into rapping as a teenager after getting therapy, and said personal traumas have influenced his music.
""We're all reporters... we have a responsibility to speak on these issues and be a voice for the voiceless and we will always be a voice for the city.
""Real change happens and I feel like that's what the show represented more than anything.""
Gareth said we can't be shy of acknowledging that there is always likely to be division.
Yet he believes more is shared across Belfast's working-class areas.
""A lot of people have this sort of warped opinion of the communities that we're from too, whether it be the Shankill or the Falls, anywhere in Belfast because they go back to this troublesome period from 30 years ago and they still stay stuck in that.
""But you'll find unification in so many ways and so many different forms now in the city than you ever have.""
The rapper said we're ""a lot closer to peace now than we've ever been"".
""There will always be division of some extent, we will never get away from that completely because that's life and not everybody likes each other and that's just plain and simple,"" he told Good Morning Ulster.
""But everybody has the right to be identified as who they identify as.
""My thing is that being a proud Protestant, being from Belfast, being from the Shankill, doesn't take away from them being proud Catholics and being from west Belfast and being from the Falls Road, why can't we unite?""
Across Young Spencer's social media platforms is the acronym P.R.O.D - but it is used more so as a set of principles to live by rather than a label.
""Passion, persistence, respect, resilience, opportunity to overcome, dedication, determination,"" he explained.
""You can look into the colours and identify my background, pick here and there and do whatever you want, but that's the core set of values and principles that got me to where I am here today and help me keep living my dream.""
So what's next for the Shankill's son?
""Inspire to inspire, motivate to motivate. Persisting with my passion when they chose to hate,"" he said.
""Respect is earned, resilience is where I was raised, opportunity comes, overcome and make your name. Determined and dedicated to making a change and that's P.R.O.D.""

Lulu headlining festival where 70% of acts female,"Scots pop icon Lulu is to headline a music festival where 70% of the acts will be female-led or have female members.
Organisers of HebCelt said they had ensured at least a 50:50 gender balance every year since 2014.
Singer-songwriter Nina Nisbet, who has been supporting Snow Patrol on tour, and Brit Award-winning musician Eddi Reader are among the other female acts due to perform in Stornoway, Lewis, in July.
There has been criticism in recent years of male domination of the music industry and some festival line-ups.

More than 30 performances have been confirmed for the main line-up, but the overall number of acts is expected to rise to more than 40 once fringe events have been confirmed.
Lulu, who has had top 10 singles since the 1960s, is known for her debut hit Shout and in the 1990s performed the song Relight My Fire with boy band Take That.
She was a headliner at last year's Glastonbury festival.
Lulu said she was looking forward to visiting the Western Isles this summer.
Josie Duncan, who will be playing with her band at HebCelt, told BBC Naidheachdan: ""I can hardly believe that Lulu is going to be in Stornoway.
""Maybe we will see her in the pub.
""But it is just mad to think that a local like myself gets the chance to be on stage alongside these incredible acts, such as Eddi Reader.""
Duncan said she hoped other festivals would follow HeCelt's example of greater representation of female talent.
""I think it has become so normal to see line-ups that are all-male that we don't even notice it,"" she said.
""This is something different.
""I personally think it should be just as normal.""
HebCelt's artist programmer and director Michelle Shields said this year's line-up highlighted diversity in music.
She added: ""This year's festival truly celebrates music across generations, from trailblazers like Lulu and Eddi Reader to the next generation of stars including Nati, Josie Duncan, and Lauren Collier.""
Other acts this year include Scottish Celtic rock band Skerryvore, who this year are marking their 20th anniversary.
Tide Lines, Beluga Lagoon, Samba Sene and Diwan, Trail West and Tom McGuire and the Brassholes are also in the line-up.
HebCelt was first held in 1996.
Over the years headliners have included Runrig, The Fratellis, The Proclaimers and KT Tunstall.
This year's festival will take place from 16 to 19 July.

Artist recreates childhood home landmarks in Lego,"An artist has been recreating landmarks of her hometown using Lego.
Kaz Taplin, who now lives in Australia, has been reconnecting with Henley on Thames in Oxfordshire by creating models of places including Gabriel Machin butchers shop and the town hall.
She works off old photographs, as well as new ones she takes when she visits her family.
Mrs Taplin said using her memories for the models was ""very inspirational"" and that it brought her ""close to home"".
She said they had moved 17 years ago from Gainsborough Crescent in Henley to the coastal city of Mandurah in Australia where they built a house.
""But I go back every few years (...) because family have passed away, so it's to respect that or to see the children (...) and the grandchildren,"" Mrs Taplin added.
The places that she chose to build Lego models of are ""part of our childhood"".
""Mum used to take us to the shops and pick up stuff, I've done a Bagatelle toy shop that's full of toys,"" she said.
""The library used to be in the town hall, so we used to go and pick up books.""
Mrs Taplin said the town hall had taken her a week to construct, and the roof had fallen apart in the process.
""But as I've been doing more and more, it's just [been taking] a few days on and off.""
She said she is now recreating a Wimpy restaurant.
""My dad used to take us into the Wimpy on Saturdays to have a burger.
""I've not quite finished that one yet, but it's very inspirational and close to home.""
Mrs Taplin said she had received ""absolutely amazing"" feedback on her work.
""I didn't think it would be like this. I'm just doing it because I like my hometown.""
The models are currently displayed on a shelf in one of her spare rooms.
Mrs Taplin said she had also completed commissioned paintings of other local landmarks such as the Henley Villa.

Mayor's medal marks independent cinema's 10th year,"An independent cinema has celebrated its 10th anniversary with a special weekend of film screenings.
The Sherborne Cinema in Gloucester is known for its art-deco interior, and for a single member of staff selling the tickets, drinks and snacks as well as starting the film.
Owner Mark Cunningham marked the occasion by showing his favourite movie, Cinema Paradiso, a foreign language film about how a man fulfils his dream by opening a cinema, along with other classics including Lady in a Van and Casablanca.
He was presented with a Mayor's Medal and certificate for his ""outstanding service to the city"".
Mr Cunningham bought the building, which dates back to 1880, in Kingsholm after noticing it being advertised by an estate agent.
""I looked at it and thought it was a lovely building,"" he said.
""I liked its arched windows. I thought 'I'm having that' and so when the deal for the Christadelphian church to buy it fell through I became the owner of a semi-derelict building.""
Mr Cunningham previously worked at the Palace Theatre cinema in Cinderford, and the Guildhall in Gloucester.
""There was an itch to have a go and it was an opportunity that was too good to miss,"" he explained.
Between 2012 and 2014 he installed the art-deco interior, for which the Sherborne Cinema is well known.
""When I started it was just a cream box. I knew I wanted to get some colour into it,"" he said.
""There are classic cinema colours, purples, browns, deep reds.""
In the entrance foyer of the cinema is an art-deco clock from the 1950s.
The auditorium has statues from the same era and ceiling chandeliers.
""There are even my mum's old velvet curtains to dampen the sound,"" added Mr Cunningham.
""The decor doesn't add to the film, but it gets people ready for an experience. You want a classical feel to add to the nostalgia.""
Mr Cunningham said it was difficult for the business to survive through the Covid-19 pandemic.
""I run this as a labour of love,"" he said.
""As I own the building, the running costs are low which helped during Covid.
""I had faith to keep going and come out the other side.""

Students get Unbelievable visit from EMF frontman,"The lead singer of 90s rock band EMF has said he ""really enjoyed"" a chance to go back to school and inspire the next generation of musicians.
James Atkin challenged students at Shrewsbury College to remix his number one single Unbelievable and said he was ""blown away"" by their response when he visited on Wednesday.
He admitted ""a few years ago this would have been my worst nightmare"", but said his outlook on life had since changed.
He added he now enjoyed nurturing new talent ""and hopefully giving them some inspiration"".
Atkin, who is due to start a tour with EMF of the UK and Australia in the spring, said it was a ""great privilege"" to be invited to speak to the Shrewsbury students and he was impressed by their work.
""Over the years we've had lots of remixes attempted of Unbelievable and people have really struggled,"" he said.
He said he believed improvements in technology had made a huge difference since they released the single in 1990.
""Things like changing the tempo and stuff like that, which would have been quite a nightmare in our day when we were working on tape and sitting in old studios,"" he added.
""I think the beautiful thing is, they can think of an idea and then they can put it into practice.""
Student Cody said the celebrity visitor was ""a really friendly guy"" who shared a few ""little fun stories"".
Another, Lottie, described him as ""very down to earth"" and said she got a lot out of their conversations.
""Hopefully the feedback I gave was positive and constructive,"" Atkin said.

Six individual lots went under the hammer at Dawsons Auctioneers in Jersey, with the most expensive painting, ""Seaweed Harvesting, Jersey"" selling for £13,000.
The collection was previously on display at Government House when Admiral Sir Randolph Stewart Gresham Nicholson served as Jersey's Lieutenant-Governor.
Jonathan Pratt, managing director of Dawsons Auctioneers, said it was ""a privilege to bring such a special collection to auction.""
The auction house said Edmund Blampied, who died in 1966, was widely regarded as Jersey's ""most renowned artist"" and was celebrated for his ability to ""capture the essence of island life with charm, character, and a deep sense of place.""
The artworks for sale included some of Mr Blampied's ""most evocative depictions of Jersey life"", it said.
Lot 10, a watercolour titled ""Peeling Potatoes"" was sold along with a letter from the artist to its previous owner for £5,500.
The letter read: ""Dear Lady Nicholson, the old lady peeling potatoes must be, I am sure, feeling so greatly honoured at being in Government House – but at the same time wishing most desperately that she had on a cleaner apron and the hat especially reserved for Sundays which is fitted with black grapes, ribbon and a kingfisher…""
Some of the other works in the sale included ""Surf Riders"" and ""Vraicking, Jersey; Study of Flowers (verso)"", which sold for £11,000 and £7,500 respectively.

BBC criticised by 500 media figures for pulling Gaza documentary,"Gary Lineker, Anita Rani, Riz Ahmed and Miriam Margolyes are among more than 500 media figures who have criticised the BBC's decision to pull a documentary about children's lives in Gaza.
The BBC has said it removed Gaza: How to Survive a War Zone from iPlayer while it carried out ""further due diligence"" after discovering its 13-year-old narrator was the son of a Hamas official.
The open letter, published by Artists for Palestine UK, criticised what the signatories said was a ""racist"" and ""dehumanising"" campaign targeting the documentary.
It called on the BBC to ""reject attempts to have the documentary permanently removed or subjected to undue disavowals"".
The corporation said it had not been informed of the teenager's family connection in advance by the film's production company.
The BBC's board is expected to discuss the film on Thursday.
The issue was also raised in the Commons by the Conservative shadow culture secretary Stuart Andrew, who accused the BBC of falling ""far short"" of its usual editorial standards and asked whether Hamas had benefitted financially from the film.
Responding, Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said she had held discussions with the BBC's director-general Tim Davie about the broadcast.
""I also sought cast iron assurances that no money paid has fallen into the hands of Hamas and that the utmost care was taken to ensure that was the case,"" she said.
""I expect to be kept informed about the findings of the internal BBC investigation, and I will be happy to update [Andrew] and colleagues across the House on its progress.""
The letter, sent to Mr Davie, BBC board chair Samir Shah, chief content officer Charlotte Moore, and CEO of BBC News Deborah Turness, said the film offered an ""all-too-rare perspective on the lived experiences of Palestinian children"".
It reads: ""Beneath this political football are children who are in the most dire circumstances of their young lives. This is what must remain at the heart of this discussion.
""As programme-makers, we are extremely alarmed by the intervention of partisan political actors on this issue, and what this means for the future of broadcasting in this country.""
The letter's other signatories include directors Ken Loach and Mike Leigh, actors Khalid Abdalla and Ruth Negga, musician Nitin Sawhney and Sarah Agha, who presented the BBC documentary series The Holy Land And Us: Our Untold Stories.
A BBC spokesperson said: ""Gaza: How to Survive a Warzone features important stories we think should be told - those of the experiences of children in Gaza.
""There have been continuing questions raised about the programme and in the light of these, we are conducting further due diligence with the production company. The programme will not be available on iPlayer while this is taking place.""",0
Volcano owners' conviction over deadly eruption thrown out,"The owners of a New Zealand volcano that erupted in 2019, killing 22 people, have had their conviction over the disaster thrown out by the country's High Court.
Whakaari Management Limited (WML) was found guilty in 2023 of failing to keep visitors safe and fined just over NZ$1m ($560,000; £445,000). They were also ordered to pay NZ$4.8m in reparation to the victims.
However, following an appeal, the High Court ruled on Friday that the company only owned the land and were not responsible for people's safety.
White Island, which is also known by its Māori name, Whakaari, is New Zealand's most active volcano and has been erupting in some form since 2011.
It had been showing signs of heightened unrest for weeks before the fatal December 2019 eruption, which killed almost half of the people who were on it at the time. Most were tourists, including 17 from Australia and three from the US.
Another 25 people were injured, with many suffering extensive burns.
High Court Justice Simon Moore said on Friday that while WML licensed tours of the volcano, there was nothing in these agreements that gave the company control of what was happening on the island day to day.
He agreed that it was reasonable for the company to rely on tour operators, as well as emergency management and science organisations, to assess risks to safety.
Justice Moore added that, in coming to his decision, he had not ignored the pain and grief of the families that had been affected.
""It is impossible not to be deeply moved and affected by the sheer scale and nature of the human loss in this case,"" he said.
Thirteen parties in total, including tour operators, were charged over the disaster. WML was the last to receive a verdict after six had pleaded guilty, while six more had their charges dismissed.
The case against WML was the largest action of its kind brought by New Zealand's regulator, Worksafe NZ, who said it acknowledged the High Court ruling and was considering whether to appeal.
James Cairney, a lawyer for James, Andrew and Peter Buttle - three brothers who own the company - said the family welcomed the decision, Radio New Zealand reported. He added that the Buttles hoped it would ""bring certainty for all landowners who grant others recreational access to their land"".
The Buttle family has owned Whakaari/White Island since the 1930s, when their grandfather bought it and placed it in a family trust. It is one of only a few privately owned islands in New Zealand.
The brothers had previously been on trial in relation to the 2019 disaster as individuals over alleged breaches of New Zealand's workplace health and safety legislation. Those charges were dismissed in 2023.",0

BP shuns renewables in return to oil and gas,"BP has announced it will cut its renewable energy investments and instead focus on increasing oil and gas production.
The energy giant revealed the shift in strategy on Wednesday following pressure from some investors unhappy its profits and share price have been lower than its rivals.
BP said it would increase its investments in oil and gas by about 20% to $10bn (£7.9bn) a year, while decreasing previously planned funding for renewables by more than $5bn (£3.9bn).
The move comes as rivals Shell and Norwegian company Equinor have also scaled back plans to invest in green energy and US President Donald Trump's ""drill baby drill"" comments have encouraged investment in fossil fuels.
Murray Auchincloss, BP's chief executive, said the energy giant had gone ""too far, too fast"" in the transition away from fossil fuels, and that its faith in green energy was ""misplaced"".
He said BP would be ""very selective"" in investing in businesses working on the energy transition to renewables going forward, with funding reduced to between $1.5bn and $2bn per year.
He said this was part of a strategy ""reset"" by the company to focus on boosting returns for shareholders.
Helge Lund, chair of BP, added that the new direction of the firm had ""cash flow growth"" at its heart.
Shares in the company climbed before Tuesday's announcement but fell shortly after.
BP is one of several firms in the energy industry to return focus on oil and gas production, which has seen an increase in profits as prices have increased following lows seen during the Covid pandemic.
The firm said it plans to increase its production to between 2.3 million and 2.5 million barrels of oil per day by 2030, with hopes of ""major"" oil and gas projects starting by the end of 2027.
Mr Auchincloss is under pressure to boost profits from some shareholders, including the influential activist group Elliot Management, which took a near £4bn stake in the £70bn company to push for more investment in oil and gas.
In 2024, BP's net income fell to $8.9bn (£7.2bn), down from $13.8bn the previous year.
However, some other shareholders, as well as environmental groups have voiced concerns over switching focus back to fossil fuel production.
Last week, a group of 48 investors called on the company to allow them a vote on any potential plans to move away from commitments to renewables.
The environmental group Greenpeace UK said the latest move was ""proof that fossil fuel companies can't or won't be part of climate crisis solutions"".
Alexander Kirk from Global Witness added BP ""cannot be trusted to deliver the clean energy transition"", adding that it was ""focusing on short-term profits to shareholders while energy prices are high, with the rest of the world picking up the tab from its climate-wrecking products"".
Global Witness drove a lorry around central London with messages criticising BP's decision.
Sir Ian Cheshire, who has held many executive roles at companies such as B&Q owner Kingfisher and Barclays bank, questioned whether BP's latest move would work.
""I do wonder whether this sort of decision will look right in 10 years,"" he told the BBC's Today programme.
""The climate change issue has not gone away, the science hasn't changed,"" he said.
Challenged on the reduced commitment to investing in renewable energy, Louise Kingham, BP's senior vice president for Europe and the UK, said none of the changes announced on Tuesday would alter the UK's green energy plans, which include three wind farms and carbon capture projects.
She said the shift to renewable energy sources had slowed but that BP's ambition had ""not changed"" to become a net-zero company.
According to the International Energy Agency, no new fossil fuel projects are compatible with limiting global warming to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels,
""We just have to do this transition more smartly and more efficiently and try to get those returns for our owners because they are helping us to do that. If we don't generate the returns, we can't invest and do more,"" Ms Kingham told the Scottish Affairs committee of MPs.
""It's going to take everybody to move in concert to make this happen. It's not just the decision of one company and what it chooses to do.""
The decrease in renewables will cover biogas, biofuels and electric vehicle charging projects, while BP will look to ""capital-light partnerships"" in other green energy such as wind and solar.
BP has already placed its offshore wind business in a joint venture with Japanese company Jera and is looking to find a partner to do the same with its solar business.
Five years ago, BP set some of the most ambitious targets among large oil companies to cut production of oil and gas by 40% by 2030, while significantly ramping up investment in renewables.
But in 2023, the company lowered this oil and gas reduction target to 25%.
In the five years since former chief executive Bernard Looney first unveiled his strategy, shareholders have received total returns including dividends of 36%.
In contrast, shareholders in rivals Shell and Exxon have seen returns of 82% and 160% respectively.
BP's under performance has prompted speculation that it may be a takeover target or may consider moving its main stock market listing to the US where oil and gas companies command higher valuations.

Bristol home for tiger found on Polish border,"A tiger found on the Poland-Belarus border will soon have a new life at a zoo in Bristol.
Aqua will be welcomed by Noah's Ark Zoo Farm this summer, and the zoo is currently trying to raise £175,000 to help build a special tiger habitat.
He was discovered in a stressed state in 2019 alongside several other tigers during a border check while being transported across Europe.
""His story is one of survival and resilience,"" said Larry Bush, the zoo's director.
The charity said the animals had suffered ""appalling conditions"" during the journey.
Mr Bush added: ""Meeting Aqua has been transformative for our team, he's truly captured the hearts of the team here.""
It is believed the tigers had been illegally traded.
Aqua was first cared for by Spanish animal welfare charity AAP Primadomus at their rescue centre in Villena, and is known for his love of water.
Aqua's new habitat will include secluded woodland and two pond areas where he can exercise, the zoo said.
He is being taken in as part of the zoo's Project Carnivora, which also includes adding Arctic foxes and vultures to the zoo's collection and extending its lion enclosure.
Work on Project Carnivora is expected to be completed in the spring.
Pablo Delgado, from AAP Primadomus, said: ""In Noah's Ark Zoo Farm we found the ideal partner to offer Aqua a new and forever home.""

Nations salvage funding deal to reverse wildlife decline,"The world's nations have agreed a funding plan at UN talks in Rome for reversing the decline of nature.
Countries were eventually able to overcome deep divisions which had led to the breakdown of negotiations last year in Colombia.
It is hoped that the deal will help countries to reach their goal of raising $200bn (£159bn) by 2030 for biodiversity action.
The current rate of species decline is so great globally that many scientists warn humans could be causing the ""sixth mass extinction"" on Earth.
The extinction rate of species globally has been rapidly accelerating over the last 50 years as animals and plants struggle to survive in the face of increased threats from human activities and climate change.
In 2022, recognising that dramatic action was needed, countries agreed a landmark deal to halt this decline of nature and agreed to protect 30% of the world's land and seas.
In order to achieve this goal countries agreed that $200bn (£159bn) a year would be mobilised by 2030, but according to the latest data from the OECD only $15bn (£12bn) has been raised.
It was hoped that at last year's UN biodiversity summit in Colombia, known as COP16, countries would come up with a new plan to close this significant funding gap.
But the negotiations broke down in dramatic fashion after the talks ran so far into overtime delegates had to leave to catch scheduled flights home.
Countries reconvened this week in Rome and after three days of, at times tense, discussion they managed to agree on a new strategy in the late hours of Thursday evening.
The deal agreed includes:
Many negotiators said they saw the agreement as a success for international cooperation in the face of increased global trade disputes.
Not all countries were present at the talks and the US was notably missing.
Initial reaction from environmental charities suggested they were happy that an agreement had been reached but reiterated the need to see actual money delivered.
Jill Hepp, biodiversity policy lead at Conservation International, said: ""While this is a moment to celebrate, we also need to see action and innovation immediately following these decisions.""
""No matter where you live or work, our food, water, livelihoods and economies all depend on a thriving natural world,"" she said.
It is estimated that over half of global GDP is dependent on nature, and up to 4 billion people rely on the world's ocean resources and forests.
Despite getting an agreement many nations have still failed to submit their strategies for tackling biodiversity loss in their own countries - the deadline for which was last year. The UK submitted its plan on Thursday.
The Joint Nature Conservation Committee (JNCC), the UK government's advisory body on nature conservation, estimated in 2023 that only 6.5% of the country's land is adequately protected.",0
Gatwick second runway backed by government,"A second runway at Gatwick Airport has been backed by government, providing measures to reduce noise are put in place.
Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was ""minded to approve"" the expansion. Some MPs, local authorities and residents are strongly opposed.
The airport wants to move its northern runway, which is currently only used for taxiing or as a back up, and make it operational by the end of the decade.
The transport secretary's support does not guarantee the expansion will go ahead as it would still need planning permission.
If permission is granted, work would start almost immediately, the BBC understands. The £2.2bn expansion will be funded through private investment.
""I am issuing a minded to approve decision that provides some additional time to seek views from all parties on the provisions, prior to a final decision,"" Alexander said in a written ministerial statement on Tuesday.
Gatwick has until 24 April to respond to demands for it to include measures, such as noise mitigation and having a proportion of passengers travelling to the airport via public transport, in its overall plans before a final decision will be made in October.
Stewart Wingate, Gatwick Airport chief executive, said following the latest announcement that the government has ""outlined a clear pathway to full approval later in the year"" and that the airport would ""engage fully"" in the process.
The Transport Secretary's support for expansion comes as the government is looking at ways to boost economic growth in a bid to boost living standards, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves backing a third runway at Heathrow last month.
Gatwick, in West Sussex, is Europe's busiest single runway airport, with more than 40 million passengers using it last year.
On Tuesday, Alexander told industry leaders aviation was good for economic growth and said she was ""not some sort of flight-shaming eco warrior"".
The growth arguments for expanding Heathrow and Gatwick, the UK's two largest airports, differ with the former catering for more freight traffic relating to international goods trade.
An extra runway at Gatwick would see capacity increased for holidaymakers and business travellers, particularly for short-haul destinations, as opposed to Heathrow's longer-haul flights.
Gatwick managers have said that with 55 take-offs and landings in a busy hour, the airport is ""full"".
Being able to use both runways could increase the number of departures by 50,000 a year by the end of the 2030s, the airport argued.
It said some 30,000 of those flights are planned to depart from the north runway which will only be used for departures and not landings.
But there is strong opposition to any expansion, particularly from climate campaigners.
Greenpeace UK policy director Douglas Parr said the extension would not drive economic growth. ""The only thing it's set to boost is air pollution, noise, and climate emissions,"" he added.
Alex Chapman, senior economist at left-of-centre think tank New Economics Foundation, also argued the move would not create new jobs, but would just shift them from other parts of the country.
""People are already perfectly able to catch cheap flights on holiday or travel for business,"" he added.
Union Unite general secretary Sharon Graham backed Gatwick having a second runway, but warned it would need ""to come with guarantees of well paid, unionised jobs and proper facilities for workers"".
Bronwen Jones, development director at Gatwick, said a second runway would be ""a win for everyone"".
She said it would create more flight slots across both runways.
""That allows us to offer new routes, new airlines, more frequencies on existing routes, so that passengers have more choice.""
Sally Pavey, chair of Communities Against Gatwick Noise Emissions (CAGNE), is worried about ""uncontrollable noise, ramifications on the roads, decline in air quality... and climate change"".
""We can't keep ignoring climate change and it would be wrong to allow a new 'bucket and spade' runway, as we put it, at the expense of residents and the economy,"" she said.
The group would take legal action through a judicial review if the expansion goes ahead, she added.
Gatwick said it has committed to reducing noise levels to below those of 2019 - which CAGNE says was one of the worst years for noise.
On Wednesday the government's independent advisers, the UK climate change committee (UKCCC), recommended that to meet the country's climate goals the amount of planet-warming gases released by the country's aviation sector needed to fall by 17% compared to 2003 levels.
Some of the pollution from flying, it said, could be reduced by switching planes to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and by capturing the planet-warming gases released.
But experts think it could be challenging to obtain the feedstock, like corn grain or food waste, needed to make SAF.
The UKCCC said the best way to reduce the industry's impact on climate change would be to significantly slow the demand for flying.
At current levels demand is expected to grow by 53% by 2040, while the UKCCC says this should be closer to 16%.

Wildlife charity fundraises to secure its future,"An animal charity is heading into its 30th year with an appeal for donations to secure its long-term future.
East Sussex Wildlife Rescue & Ambulance Service (WRAS) was founded in 1996 by Trevor Weeks MBE, who has dedicated 40 years to this labour of love after joining the Eastbourne Conservation Volunteers at the age of 13.
The Whitesmith facility, which receives over 30,000 calls and manages 6,500 cases each year, is now equipped to handle up to 450 animals at a time.
Mr Weeks, 53, said WRAS was ""trying to get bigger and better all the time"" but faced a relentless workload.
""The volume of animals we're now dealing with...it just makes you wonder, 'where is it going to stop?',"" he said.
After more than a decade working with animals, it was an intervention from local vet Robin Hooper that ultimately led to Mr Weeks founding WRAS.
Mr Hooper had challenged Mr Weeks to address mounting veterinary bills, and in response, WRAS was born.
The founder admitted he was ""quite surprised"" to have spent four decades in wildlife care, but said it had proven ""a really good focus"" after losing his mum when just 21.
""It became my crutch, my support,"" Mr Weeks added.
The organisation now has nine full-time staff and over 200 volunteers and is dealing with more casualties than ever before.
To continue managing this demand, the charity needs to expand and upgrade its hospital facilities - work that requires funding, said Mr Weeks.
This has prompted WRAS to launch an anniversary appeal that's now open for donations.
Funds raised from an 80-mile (128km) trek to be undertaken by Mr Weeks will also go towards building a new facility.
The WRAS founder will walk from Bewl Water on the Kent border to Eastbourne seafront over 11 days, hoping to finish on 28 March.

Thousands of seals counted thanks to AI and drones,"A new scientific study using the latest technology has counted 2,300 more seals on a stretch of beach - and could go on to help conservation efforts.
Volunteers on the ground counted 6,200 seals along a 8km (4.9-mile) run of shoreline around Winterton-on-Sea in Norfolk.
But more than 8,500 seals were counted by drone cameras and the use of artificial intelligence (AI).
""This difference is likely due to the drone's aerial perspective,"" said Gabriella Fasoli, a scientist at Natural England, which is running a pilot project.
""[It] provides a unique viewpoint from above, allowing for a more accurate count by detecting seals that may be hidden or less visible from the ground.""
Seal populations have previously been monitored through observations made on the ground and aerial surveys.
Natural England, which advises the government on the natural environment, said this had sometimes caused problems in collecting accurate data.
It had proved particularly challenging in hard to reach areas.
In December, a specialist team sent up a drone with high-resolution cameras to capture images from 110m (360ft) above, as part of the two-year pilot.
However, while the new methods - which minimise disturbance to the animals - will enhance the accuracy of assessing the UK seal population's size, Natural England say volunteers will still remain crucial in recording numbers.
Emma Milner, the agency's senior marine mammal specialist, said the project had shown there was now a ""cost and time efficient alternative"" to monitoring seal populations.
""This cutting-edge technology will help contribute to a comprehensive national picture of seal populations, allowing us to better understand population changes over time,"" she said.
She added it would also let it ""assess the impact of human activity on these crucial habitats, enabling better conservation efforts"".
The UK hosts 35% of the global population of grey seals and is an important breeding ground, according to Natural England.
Special permission was given to fly the drones, with best practice also followed to not disturb the animals.
People are not allowed to fly drones over the seals without the appropriate permissions, Natural England warned.

Heat pumps and EVs – how to fight climate change from home,"Households will need to make significant changes to their lifestyles to help the UK reach net zero by 2050, says the government's independent climate advisers.
In its latest advice, known as the carbon budget, the Climate Change Committee (CCC) says by 2040, 80% of cars should be electric and one in two homes have a heat pump.
Here are some of the ways it says you can cut greenhouse gas emissions:
Decarbonising home heating will be essential if the country is going to reach its legally binding net zero target by 2050.
Our homes are the second biggest source of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions after transport, and 80% of those emissions are from gas boilers. The proportion has been increasing as the country generates more electricity from low-carbon technologies like renewables and nuclear.
The CCC is backing heat pumps as the main replacement for gas boilers and rules out using hydrogen.
It says only about 60,000 UK homes installed a heat pump in 2023. It wants that figure to be 450,000 by 2030 and 1.5 million by 2035.
However, it recognises that is going to be difficult. A key problem is heat pumps are typically more expensive than gas boilers, even after the government's £7,500 grant. And because they heat water to a lower temperature than boilers, they work better in well-insulated homes with larger radiators or underfloor heating.
The committee says the government needs to consider schemes to help lower income households cover at least some of the costs of these changes.
The hope is that as boilers break down, consumers will replace them with heat pumps. The report doesn't recommend a ban on new boilers but says by 2035 all new heating systems should be low carbon.
A quarter of UK emissions come from transport – excluding aviation – making it another priority for carbon cuts. But the CCC is less worried about how these will be achieved.
That is because it believes continuing reductions in the cost of batteries and other technologies mean electric cars and vans (EVs) could be cheaper to buy than petrol and diesel vehicles as soon as next year. This is significantly cheaper when you take into account running costs. It believes we will naturally choose them when we're looking for a new car.
In 2023, 16% of new cars were fully electric - the government says that will be 55% by 2027 and 95% by 2030.
The CCC says government will need to support the rollout of the charging network, and that the cost of charging needs to fall and payment be simplified.
It expects the switchover will become increasingly rapid, partly because it believes it will become more difficult to buy petrol and diesel, as it is expected there will be fewer petrol stations by 2040.
We are going to need to change our diets, the CCC says. That is because agriculture is the fourth highest emitting sector in the UK economy and nearly two-thirds (63%) of those emissions are from livestock.
However, the CCC is careful not recommend restrictions on what we eat. Instead, it anticipates the current slow drift towards more plant-based foods will continue in the years to come. By 2040 it estimates we will be eating 25% less meat and 20% less dairy.
Meat products will initially be replaced by existing alternative protein products like plant-based burgers, but in later years it expects us to start eating more ""alternative proteins"". These include oils and meat grown from animal cells in bio-reactors - fermentation tanks like you might see in a brewery. The first product using these cultivated meats for animal consumption went on sale earlier this month.
Our changing diets will mean cattle and sheep numbers will need to fall by 27% as a result, it says. That will allow a shift towards woodland creation, the restoration of the country's peatlands and allow more land to be used to grow energy crops.
UK farmers will need to be supported during this transition, it advises, and the government will need to be careful to ensure that low-carbon UK food is not just replaced by higher-carbon products imported from abroad.
Aviation is currently the sixth biggest source of UK emissions, but by 2040 the CCC reckons it will be the biggest.
In the past the committee has advised government there should be no expansion of UK airports without a clear plan to cut emissions from the sector. The government is expected to announce its support for a new runway at Gatwick on Thursday, so is likely to be relieved the CCC has dropped that recommendation from this latest carbon budget.
But it says the aviation industry will need to pick up the tab for the costs of decarbonising the sector. That is going to require technological innovation – more efficient jets and electric planes – and the increasing use of sustainable aviation fuels (SAF).
SAF is made from plant products or by combining captured CO2 with hydrogen. Just 1% of jet fuel is currently SAF, but the CCC expects that to rise to 17% by 2040.
Any emissions the industry cannot eliminate will need to be offset by what the CCC calls ""engineered removals"". That means using technologies to take CO2 out of the atmosphere and store it permanently underground.
All of which is going to be expensive and will drive up ticket prices. The CCC expects those higher prices will slow down the increase in passenger numbers in years to come. However, it still expects a 28% increase in passenger numbers by 2050 – with UK residents taking a total of 402 million flights a year.
It has a warning though. If all that new tech doesn't cut emissions as much as the industry is expecting, the government may need to impose limits on flight numbers.",0
"Heat pumps: How do they work, what do they cost and can I get a grant?","About half of all homes should have a heat pump by 2040 to keep the UK on track to meet its climate targets, according to the government's independent advisers.
Less than 1% of homes had heat pumps in 2023, but take-up has increased sharply since then and the the Climate Change Committee (CCC) believes the goal is achievable.
Heat pumps run on electricity instead of gas. They warm buildings by absorbing and amplifying heat from the air, ground, or water.
They are widely seen as the best way of cutting emissions of carbon dioxide - a planet-warming gas - from home heating. They are more efficient than gas boilers and can use electricity generated from increasingly clean sources, as wind and solar power replace polluting fossil fuels.
Air-source pumps - the most common type - suck in outdoor air and pass it over tubes containing refrigerant fluids which concentrate and boost the warmth to produce heat.
The system consists of a box measuring about 1m x 1m x 0.4m which stands outside the property, as well as a heat pump unit and hot water cylinder inside the property. The indoor unit is about the size of a gas boiler, while the cylinder depends on the size of the home.
Ground-source heat pumps are more efficient than air-source models. But they are typically more expensive and less commonly used, as they require a deep bore hole, or a horizontal system dug into the ground over a large area.
On average, an air-source heat pump costs about £10,000 more than a gas boiler, according to the National Infrastructure Commission (NIC). Installation costs can vary greatly depending on the changes needed to fit the pump into a property.
To encourage people to make the switch, the government offers a grant of £7,500 to help with the extra costs in England and Wales.
With the grant, some energy companies offer heat pumps for as little as £500, but the UK's spending watchdog warned in 2024 that costs were too high for many.
The grant can be used for existing homes and non-domestic buildings in England and Wales. The property must have an eligible Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) issued in the last 10 years.
Changes to the rules mean homes are no longer required to have existing loft or cavity wall insulation, which could save around £2,500 in upfront costs, but a well-insulated home can help the heat pump to perform more efficiently.
The scheme is not available if you live in social housing or a new-build property. Tenants in private rented accommodation are also eligible but the landlord has to apply.
Scotland and Northern Ireland have separate schemes to help make homes more efficient.
While the up-front costs are currently significant, heat pumps tend to be cheaper to run than gas boilers, the CCC says.
The precise comparison depends on individual energy prices and how efficiently the heat pump works.
Electric heat pumps use much less energy than gas boilers, but electricity typically costs more than gas.
Households can make additional savings by signing up for energy deals which are designed for heat pump owners.
The CCC has called on the government to prioritise making electricity cheaper for everyone, which would make heat pumps more attractive.
As a first step, it says the government should remove the cost of funding social and environment schemes which is currently included in electricity bills.
It says this would allow people to make savings on their energy bills.
Fewer heat pumps been installed in the UK than in European countries such as France, Germany, the Netherlands and Scandinavian nations.
According to the CCC, about 60,000 heat pumps were installed in 2023, although numbers have been going up quickly since then.
It says this number needs to rise to nearly 450,000 a year by 2030 and 1.5 million by 2035 - but argues this is feasible based on equivalent increases already seen in some other European countries.
Significantly more trained heat pump installers are also needed.
There is no requirement to replace your existing boiler before the end of its life, and the CCC says this should not be necessary in order to meet climate targets. Households can still buy a new gas boiler if they wish.
But the CCC has recommended that, from 2035, all new home heating should be low-carbon.
The government will respond to its latest advice in due course, but Energy Secretary Ed Miliband has previously said that the government was not planning an outright ban on gas boilers.
Most low-carbon heating over the next 15 years will come from heat pumps, the CCC says.
But in some cases, other approaches may be more appropriate, such as direct electric heating in homes with lower heat demand.
However, the CCC says the government should rule out the possible use of hydrogen in home heating to provide certainty to customers and industry.",0
"Half of homes need heat pump by 2040, government told","Four in five cars should be electric and half of homes should have heat pumps within 15 years, say the government's independent climate advisers.
By law the UK must reach ""net zero"" - no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere - by 2050.
UK greenhouse gas emissions have more than halved since 1990, largely thanks to less electricity coming from fossil fuels and more from renewables. But the Climate Change Committee (CCC) says that to reach the 2050 target we will also need to change how we drive and heat our homes.
Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said the government would consider the advice and respond in due course.
""We owe it to current generations to seize the opportunities for energy security and lower bills, and we owe it to future generations to tackle the existential climate crisis,"" he said.
Under UK law, the CCC provides independent advice on how much the UK should emit over five-year periods, known as ""carbon budgets"", and how it might get there.
Each carbon budget is a stepping stone to net zero by 2050. The latest advice is that by 2040, emissions should be 13% of their 1990 levels, for the UK to stay on track.
The CCC advice is not policy, but the government has historically accepted it. If it does, the target will become legally binding, but government will still decide how to achieve it.
Meeting these long-term goals will mean significant changes in the years ahead. One-third of emissions cuts between now and 2040 need to come from households making low-carbon choices, the CCC says.
This will mainly be through switching from petrol and diesel cars to electric vehicles and from fossil fuel boilers to heat pumps, making use of growing supplies of clean electricity. Smaller contributions will come from other choices, such as eating less meat and dairy.
As the graph below shows, these changes are ambitious. But they are deliverable, argues the CCC, without people having to scrap their existing boiler or car early.
Other emerging technologies, like mobile phones and internet connections, have achieved similar rates of increases previously.
""For electric vehicles, the market is already pretty much at parity with internal combustion engine vehicles, so we think just naturally that will start to be a choice people make,"" Emma Pinchbeck, chief executive of the CCC, told the BBC's Today programme.
""For heat pumps, we're saying it's different, the costs are still higher than a fossil fuel boiler and the government will need to act to help people get those technologies.
""But the rollout rate that we've looked at is similar to what happened to our neighbours in Ireland but also to much colder countries in Europe.""
Emissions cuts will be needed in other areas too, such as farming and flying, two of the hardest sectors to decarbonise.
The CCC no longer directly advises against net airport expansion, which it has previously. But it warns the costs of decarbonising aviation will need to be picked up by airlines, which will probably drive up ticket prices.
It says we will need to eat less meat and dairy too. In the CCC's pathway, sheep and cattle numbers fall by 27% by 2040, and the area covered by woodland rises from 13% to 16%.
The costs of tackling climate change have become highly politicised in recent years.
The CCC estimates most of the expense will be borne by the private sector and calculates the savings from moving to more efficient technologies should outweigh costs by the early 2040s.
""We are crystal clear in this analysis, in this carbon budget, for the first time we start to see the economy making savings from this investment, and they make savings over and above what we would do if we stay dependent on fossil fuels,"" Ms Pinchbeck told BBC News.
This should improve energy security and filter down to lower bills in the long term, the CCC argues, provided the government acts to make electricity cheaper.
It advises removing policy costs – funding for social and environmental schemes – from electricity bills. That would cut them by about 19% based on expected 2025 prices, the CCC says, making it more cost-effective for people to switch to electric vehicles or heat pumps.
These costs could instead sit on gas bills or general taxation.
""Regardless of what you think about climate change, what we are laying out today is a massive industrial revolution,"" said Ms Pinchbeck.
""It will save the economy money by 2040, it saves people money on their energy bills, it saves people money on their driving costs, but all of that is underpinned by a cheaper electricity price.""

Scientists probe gulls' 'weird and wonderful' appetites,"From pilfering chips to swallowing whole starfish, gulls are known for their voracious appetites.
However, one scientist was so astounded to see pictures on social media of gulls eating ""weird and wonderful things"" that she launched a citizen science project to study their shifting diets.
University of Salford ecologist Dr Alice Risely wants people to upload their snaps of hungry gulls to the project's website, Gulls Eating Stuff.
""By studying gulls' diet, we can learn more about their behaviour, their role in ecosystems and the pressures they face in a changing world,"" she said.
UK seabirds face threats from warming oceans, overfishing and avian flu.
Gull populations are in decline, with several species on the UK red list of conservation concern.
Some gulls are coming to live closer to people, adding human leftovers to their natural menu of fish, crabs, starfish and earthworms.
The birds may be flocking to urban areas to find food to feed their chicks during the breeding season, switching back to a natural diet once their youngsters have fledged.
Alternatively, gulls may be relying on human leftovers for much of the year as the natural food supply dwindles.
""The fact is we just really don't know – there is very little data,"" said Dr Risely.
""This is why we wanted to exploit this resource of online photos to try and help us understand what the gulls are eating, and if there are any patterns we can find.""
One particularly striking photograph shows a gull eating a baby puffin.
It was taken by scientist Samuel Schmidt on a trip to the Farne Islands in Northumberland.
Getting more information on what gulls are eating - in proximity to people and as the climate changes - ""could be very enlightening"", he said.
""The gull wasn't malicious; it was just hungry,"" he added.
Gulls are known to eat other birds, including pigeons.
The UK is known for its huge colonies of seabirds nesting on cliffs - but populations are plummeting amid a host of pressures, from climate change to a lack of food.
Gulls are in trouble in their natural spaces - and some species, such as herring gulls and lesser black-backed gulls are seeking refuge in coastal cities.
There is very little data on the number of urban gulls - but natural populations are regularly monitored, showing big declines.
Three gull species are on the UK red list of conservation concern:

World's glaciers melting faster than ever recorded,"The world's glaciers are melting faster than ever recorded under the impact of climate change, according to the most comprehensive scientific analysis to date.
Mountain glaciers - frozen rivers of ice – act as a freshwater resource for millions of people worldwide and lock up enough water to raise global sea-levels by 32cm (13in) if they melted entirely.
But since the turn of the century, they have lost more than 6,500 billion tonnes – or 5% – of their ice.
And the pace of melting is increasing. Over the past decade or so, glacier losses were more than a third higher than during the period 2000-2011.
The study combined more than 230 regional estimates from 35 research teams around the world, making scientists even more confident about exactly how fast glaciers are melting, and how they will evolve in the future.
Glaciers are excellent indicators of climate change.
In a stable climate, they remain roughly the same size, gaining about as much ice through snowfall as they lose through melting.
But glaciers have been shrinking pretty much everywhere over the past 20 years as temperatures have risen due to human activities, principally burning fossil fuels.
Between 2000 and 2023, glaciers outside the major ice-sheets of Greenland and Antarctica lost around 270 billion tonnes of ice a year on average.
These numbers aren't easy to get your head around. So Michael Zemp, director of the World Glacier Monitoring Service and lead author of the study, uses an analogy.
The 270 billion tonnes of ice lost in a single year ""corresponds to the [water] consumption of the entire global population in 30 years, assuming 3 litres per person and day"", he told BBC News.
The rate of change in some regions has been particularly extreme. Central Europe, for example, has lost 39% of its glacier ice in little over 20 years.
The novelty of this study, published in the journal Nature, is not so much finding that glaciers are melting faster and faster – we already knew that. Instead, its strength lies in drawing together evidence from across the research community.
There are various ways of estimating how glaciers are changing, from field measurements to different types of satellite data. Each has its own advantages and disadvantages.
Direct measurements on glaciers, for example, give very detailed information, but are only available for a tiny fraction of the more than 200,000 glaciers worldwide.
By systematically combining these different approaches, scientists can be much more certain about what's going on.
These community estimates ""are vital as they give people confidence to make use of their findings"", said Andy Shepherd, head of the Department of Geography and Environment at Northumbria University, who was not an author of the recent study.
""That includes other climate scientists, governments, and industry, plus of course anyone who is concerned about the impacts of global warming.""
Glaciers take time to fully respond to a changing climate – depending on their size, anywhere between a few years and many decades.
That means they will continue to melt in the years ahead.
But, crucially, the amount of ice lost by the end of the century will strongly depend on how much humanity continues to warm the planet by releasing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases.
This could be the difference between losing a quarter of the world's glacier ice, if global climate targets are met, and nearly half if warming continues uncontrolled, the study warns.
""Every tenth of a degree of warming that we can avoid will save some glaciers, and will save us from a lot of damage,"" Prof Zemp explained.
These consequences go beyond local changes to landscapes and ecosystems – or ""what happens on the glacier doesn't stay there"", as Prof Zemp puts it.
Hundreds of millions of people worldwide rely to some extent on seasonal meltwater from glaciers, which act like giant reservoirs to help buffer populations from drought. When the glaciers disappear, so does their supply of water.
And there are global consequences too. Even seemingly small increases to global sea-level – from mountain glaciers, the major Greenland and Antarctic ice-sheets, and warmer ocean waters taking up more space - can significantly increase the frequency of coastal flooding.
""Every centimetre of sea-level rise exposes another 2 million people to annual flooding somewhere on our planet,"" said Prof Shepherd.
Global sea-levels have already risen by more than 20cm (8in) since 1900, with around half of that coming since the early 1990s, and faster increases are expected in the decades ahead.

"How Trump's 'drill, baby, drill' pledge is affecting other countries","The UN climate summit in the United Arab Emirates in 2023 ended with a call to ""transition away from fossil fuels"". It was applauded as a historic milestone in global climate action.
Barely a year later, however, there are fears that the global commitment may be losing momentum, as the growth of clean energy transition is slowing down while burning of fossil fuels continues to rise.
And now there is US President Donald Trump's ""national energy emergency"", embracing fossil fuels and ditching clean energy policies – that has also begun to influence some countries and energy companies already.
In response to Trump's ""drill, baby, drill"" slogan aimed at ramping up fossil fuel extraction, and the US notifying the UN of its withdrawal from the Paris climate agreement, Indonesia, for instance, has hinted that it may follow suit.
""If the United States does not want to comply with the international agreement, why should a country like Indonesia comply with it?"" asked Hashim Djojohadikusumo, special envoy for climate change and energy of Indonesia, as reported by the country's government-run news agency Antara.
Indonesia has remained in the list of top 10 carbon-emitting countries for years now.
""Indonesia produces three tons of carbon [per person a year] while the US produces 13 tons,"" he asked at the ESG Sustainable Forum 2025 in Jakarta on 31 January.
""Yet we are the ones being told to close our power plants... So, where is the sense of justice here?""
Nithi Nesadurai, director with Climate Action Network Southeast Asia, said the signals from her region were concerning.
She said the ""richest country and the largest oil producer in the world"" increasing its production gives other states ""an easy excuse to increase their own - which they are already doing"".
In South Africa, Africa's biggest economy and a major carbon emitter, a $8.5bn foreign-aided transition project from the coal sector was already moving at a snail's pace, and now there are fears that it may get derailed further.
Wikus Kruger, director of Power Futures Lab at the University of Cape Town, said there was a ""possibility"" that decommissioning of old coal-fired power stations would be ""further delayed"".
However he said that while there was some ""walk back"" from transition to renewables, there was still growth in the clean energy sector that was expected to continue.
Argentina withdrew its negotiators from the COP29 climate meeting in Baku last November, days after Trump won the US presidency. It has since followed Trump's lead in signalling it will withdraw from the Paris Agreement of 2015 - which underpins global efforts to combat climate change.
""We now expect our oil and gas production to go up,"" Enrique Viale, president of the Argentine Association of Environmental Lawyers, told the BBC.
""President Milei has hinted that he intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and has said environmentalism is part of the woke agenda.""
Meanwhile, energy giant Equinor has just announced it is halving investment in renewable energy over the next two years while increasing oil and gas production, and another oil major, BP, is expected to make a similar announcement soon.
Trump has not just said ""drill, baby, drill"" but also: ""We will export American energy all over the world.""
Potential foreign buyers are already lining up.
India and the US have agreed to significantly increase the supply of American oil and gas to the Indian market.
At the end of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's US visit on 14 February, the two countries issued a joint statement that ""reaffirmed"" the US would be ""a leading supplier of crude oil and petroleum products and liquified natural gas to India"".
A few days after Trump's inauguration, South Korea, the world's third largest liquified natural gas importer, has hinted its intention to buy more American oil and gas aimed at reducing a trade surplus with the US and improving energy security, international media have reported from Seoul.
Officials with Japan's largest power generator, JERA, have told Reuters they too want to increase purchases of liquified natural gas from the US to diversify supply, as it currently imports half of it from the Asia-Pacific region.
""There is certainly a threat that if the US seeks to either flood markets with cheap fossil fuels, or bully countries into buying more of its fossil fuels, or both, the global energy transition might be slowed,"" said Lorne Stockman, research director with Oil Change International, a research and advocacy organisation for transition to clean energy.
Scientists have said there can be no new fossil fuel extraction and there needs to be a rapid reduction of carbon emissions (around 45% by 2030 from the 2019 level) if the world is to limit warming to 1.5 Celsius compared to the pre-industrial period.
""The economics of energy supply are a key driver of decarbonisation,"" said David Brown, director of energy transition practice at Wood Mackenzie, a global energy think-tank.
""The resource base of US energy supports the role of natural gas and liquids production. By contrast, import-dependent economies such as China, India, and those in Southeast Asia have a dramatic economic incentive to decarbonise sources of energy.""
Global energy transition investment surpassed $2tn for the first time last year but studies have also shown that the growth of clean energy transition has markedly slowed in recent years, while many major banks continue to finance fossil fuels.",0
World's sea-ice falls to record low,"The world's frozen oceans, which help to keep the planet cool, currently have less ice than ever previously recorded, satellite data shows.
Sea-ice around the north and south poles acts like a giant mirror by reflecting much of the Sun's energy back into space.
But as rising temperatures cause this bright layer to shrink, the dark ocean below can absorb more heat, warming the planet further.
This latest sea-ice low appears to have been driven by a combination of warm air, warm seas and winds breaking apart the ice.
Over the 5 days to 13 February, the combined extent of Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice was 15.76 million sq km (6.08 million sq miles), according to BBC analysis of data from the US National Snow and Ice Data Center (NSIDC).
This breaks the previous 5-day record low of 15.93 million sq km (6.15 million sq miles) from January-February 2023.
Arctic sea-ice is currently at its smallest recorded extent for the time of year, while Antarctic sea-ice is close to a new low in satellite records going back to the late 1970s.
The decline of Arctic sea-ice in response to a warming planet is well-established. Its end-of-summer extent fell from an average of 7 million sq km in the 1980s to 4.5 million sq km in the 2010s.
But until the mid-2010s, Antarctic sea-ice had been remarkably resilient, defying predictions that it would shrink.
Since then, Antarctica has shown a series of very low sea-ice extents, although there is still lots of natural variability.
""Every year, every data point that we get suggests that this isn't a temporary shift, but something more permanent, like what we've seen in the Arctic,"" Walter Meier, senior research scientist at NSIDC, told BBC News.
""It is indicating that the Antarctic has moved into a new regime of lower ice extents.""
Antarctic sea-ice is relatively thin and mobile - being surrounded by ocean rather than continents like the Arctic - so it can be particularly sensitive to winds breaking up the ice.
But warmer air and warmer waters look to have played a key role in this latest 2025 low, towards the end of the southern hemisphere summer.
The Antarctic ice-shelves – ice flowing off the Antarctic continent, rather than sea-ice – appear to have had a particularly extreme season of surface melting, driven by high air temperatures.
""Atmospheric conditions in December and January looked like they were strongly promoting surface melting on the ice-shelves,"" said Tom Bracegirdle, research scientist at the British Antarctic Survey.
""That could also have contributed to what we've seen in Antarctic sea-ice, and ongoing ocean warming is setting the backdrop to all of this as well.""
Antarctica's record sea-ice low of 2023 would have been a one-in-2,000 year event without climate change, according to a recent study. Yet 2025 is not far from eclipsing it.
At the other end of the planet, the Arctic should be reaching its annual maximum, with cold winter temperatures helping the oceans to freeze over.
But current sea-ice extent is nearly 0.2 million sq km below anything previously recorded for the time of year, and has been tracking very low since late 2024.
This is partly as a result of a late freeze-up of ice around Hudson Bay, with unusually warm ocean waters taking a long time to cool down.
As well as warmer seas, some storms also disrupted ice around the Barents and Bering Seas, with the consequences likely amplified by long-term reductions in sea-ice thickness.
""A thinner ice cover is more responsive to weather [… so] weather events can have a stronger impact than they used to,"" said Julienne Stroeve, professor of polar observation and modelling at University College London.
In recent weeks, Arctic sea-ice has moved even further below average. Temperatures around the north pole were about 20C above normal in early February, leading to melting conditions in places like Svalbard.
This ""is quite astonishing"" for the time of year, according to Dr Bracegirdle.
This very low winter extent doesn't necessarily mean the Arctic will end up with record conditions throughout 2025, as conditions can change quickly at the poles.
But, with the Arctic warming nearly four times faster than the global average, declines over the coming decades are almost inevitable.
The Arctic is expected to be essentially free of sea-ice at the end of its summer at least once before 2050, according to the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Some recent studies suggest it could happen sooner.
Declining sea-ice at both poles not only has implications for local wildlife like polar bears and penguins, but also the Earth's climate.
Polar sea-ice has already lost around 14% of its natural cooling effect since the early-to-mid 1980s, as the area of bright, reflective ice has declined, according to a study published last year.
""If you significantly change the sea ice distribution in and around Antarctica, you modify that part of the planet which is actually helping us fight against climate change,"" said Simon Josey, a professor at the National Oceanography Centre.
Sea-ice also plays an important role in the great ocean conveyor, the mass movement of water that helps distribute heat around the planet and keeps places like the UK and north-west Europe relatively mild.
""If we see another strong winter loss [of Antarctic sea-ice], people are going to start to worry about what it's doing to the ocean circulation,"" said Prof Josey.

Scillonian III ferry all set for 'final season',"Final preparations are under way for the Scillonian III ferry to start sailing to the Isles of Scilly next month on what could be her last season.
The vessel came into service in 1977 and has made more than 10,000 trips to the islands.
Senior managers at the Isles of Scilly Steamship Group (ISSG) have said the ferry was now 48 years old and it was now time to look forward.
Her replacement, the Scillonian IV, and a new cargo vessel were both under construction in Vietnam and were scheduled to enter service in the spring of 2026.
The Scillonian III has made the 36 mile (58km) journey from Penzance harbour to St Mary's harbour on the Isles of Scilly more than 10,000 times.
The ferry has travelled over 388,500 nautical miles and carried over five million passengers since entering service in 1977.
However, the 223ft (68m) ship, which sails between March and November, has experienced some mechanical issues.
An engine problem meant she had to operate on half power for a few days in September 2024 and journey times were increased from two hours 45 mins to four hours.
The crane that lifts cargo into the hold also broke last year and mobile cranes were brought in to the quays in Penzance and St Mary's.
The Isles of Scilly Steamship Group CEO Stuart Reid said he hoped their problems were behind them.
""The crane has been completely overhauled and the engine has been tested and everything is looking good for the first sailing,"" he said.
The Scillonian IV and the cargo vessel Menawethan were under construction at the French boatbuilder Piriou's shipyard in Vietnam.
Both were scheduled to start service next spring but CEO Stuart Reid was remaining cautious.
""All of the hull blocks are now in place for the Menawethen and around 75% are in place for Scillonian IV,"" he said.
""Shipbuilding is a complex process, we remain on track but there are a number of challenges to come, including delivery of the vessels from Vietnam under their own steam which is likely to take up to 50 days.""
The new passenger vessel will have a 24% higher capacity of 600 and stabilisation technology to make her more comfortable in heavy seas.
The cargo vessel Menawethen will replace the old Gry Maritha - she is named after one of the 12 uninhabited Eastern Isles.
She will have an increased cargo capacity and more space for chilled and frozen goods.

Government priorities set out in plan update,"An updated roadmap outlining six strategic priorities for the government before the 2026 general election is set to be debated by Tynwald members next month.
Plans to deliver £50m of public sector efficiency savings, along with initiatives to increase housing occupancy and address the need for homes are among the key goals.
First published in 2022, the Island Plan has been updated annually, with the latest changes creating the final iteration of the document for the current administration.
Chief minister Alfred Cannan said the actions in the update showed the government was ""responding to the world around us"", and ""continually refining"" how to reach goals.
The document outlined measures to improve security such as Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR), which is set to be introduced at ports, with facial recognition measures also set to come into force in the coming year.
The document also includes the introduction of a system of registration for employment agencies and immigration advice services would be set up to ensure those who work on the island have the right to do so.
Improving travel connectivity has been highlighted as another core aim, with efforts to secure core air routes to London, north-west England and Dublin on long-term deals with airlines set to continue before looking at other routes.
Work to improve energy security would also continue in the year ahead, with offshore and onshore energy projects underway and plans to integrate solar energy generation on the government estate set to begin.
The government document also outlines plans to increase the minimum salary levels required to for some work visas routes, and make a decision on the island's approach to introducing a new health surcharge.
Other measures aimed at boosting the economy include developing artificial intelligence capabilities, growing the tourism sector, and work on high street renewal through the local economy strategy,
The document will be put forward for Tynwald approval in March.

Qatar Airways says crew handled dead passenger 'appropriately',"Qatar Airways says an internal review has found that its crew ""acted quickly, appropriately and professionally"" when they placed the body of a woman who died mid-flight next to an Australian couple.
The airline issued the statement to the BBC on Friday, after the couple told Australia's Channel Nine that they were traumatised by the experience on the Melbourne to Doha flight.
Qatar Airways had apologised in a previous statement for ""any inconvenience or distress this incident may have caused"".
The incident sparked debate over procedures on dealing with deaths aboard planes.
Mitchell Ring and Jennifer Colin, who were travelling to Venice for a holiday, said the cabin crew had placed the dead woman, covered in blankets, next to Mr Ring for the last four hours of a 14-hour flight.
The cabin crew had trouble moving her body through the aisle to the business class section because ""she was quite a large lady"", Mr Ring said.
They then asked Mr Ring to move over and placed the lady in the seat he was in.
While Ms Colin was invited by another passenger to sit beside her across the aisle, Mr Ring said the plane's staff did not offer to move him elsewhere even though there were vacant seats around.
Qatar Airways said on Friday that the crew's handling of the woman's death was ""in line with training and industry standard practice"".
""Passengers were accommodated to other seats, and a crew member was sitting at all times with the deceased passenger for the duration of the flight until landing in Doha,"" its statement said.
""It is an unfortunate reality that unexpected deaths do sometimes occur on board aircraft across the aviation industry and our crew are highly trained to deal with these situations with as much respect and dignity as possible.""
The airline also said that they have offered support and compensation to the family of the deceased and other passengers who were ""directly affected"" by the incident.
""We totally understand that we can't hold the airline responsible for the poor lady's death, but surely after that there has to be a protocol to look after the customers on board,"" Ms Colin said in the televised interview with Channel 9.
When the plane landed, Mr Ring said passengers were asked to stay put while medical staff and police came on board. Ambulance officers then started pulling blankets off the woman and he saw her face, he said.
""I can't believe they told us to stay,"" he said, adding that he thought they would have let the passengers leave before medical staff arrived.
Barry Eustance, a former Virgin Atlantic captain, earlier told the BBC that in his experience ""the crew would normally try to isolate the body, so there is no passenger exposure to the body and vice versa, for respect and privacy but also for medical reasons"".
According to the guidelines by the International Air Transport Association on dealing with deaths on board a flight, the deceased person should be moved to a seat, preferably one with few other passengers nearby, and covered with a blanket or body bag up to the neck. The body could also be moved to another area that does not obstruct an aisle or exit.
Upon landing, the association recommends that other passengers disembark before the body is attended to by local authorities.

Gatwick second runway backed by government,"A second runway at Gatwick Airport has been backed by government, providing measures to reduce noise are put in place.
Transport Secretary Heidi Alexander said she was ""minded to approve"" the expansion. Some MPs, local authorities and residents are strongly opposed.
The airport wants to move its northern runway, which is currently only used for taxiing or as a back up, and make it operational by the end of the decade.
The transport secretary's support does not guarantee the expansion will go ahead as it would still need planning permission.
If permission is granted, work would start almost immediately, the BBC understands. The £2.2bn expansion will be funded through private investment.
""I am issuing a minded to approve decision that provides some additional time to seek views from all parties on the provisions, prior to a final decision,"" Alexander said in a written ministerial statement on Tuesday.
Gatwick has until 24 April to respond to demands for it to include measures, such as noise mitigation and having a proportion of passengers travelling to the airport via public transport, in its overall plans before a final decision will be made in October.
Stewart Wingate, Gatwick Airport chief executive, said following the latest announcement that the government has ""outlined a clear pathway to full approval later in the year"" and that the airport would ""engage fully"" in the process.
The Transport Secretary's support for expansion comes as the government is looking at ways to boost economic growth in a bid to boost living standards, with Chancellor Rachel Reeves backing a third runway at Heathrow last month.
Gatwick, in West Sussex, is Europe's busiest single runway airport, with more than 40 million passengers using it last year.
On Tuesday, Alexander told industry leaders aviation was good for economic growth and said she was ""not some sort of flight-shaming eco warrior"".
The growth arguments for expanding Heathrow and Gatwick, the UK's two largest airports, differ with the former catering for more freight traffic relating to international goods trade.
An extra runway at Gatwick would see capacity increased for holidaymakers and business travellers, particularly for short-haul destinations, as opposed to Heathrow's longer-haul flights.
Gatwick managers have said that with 55 take-offs and landings in a busy hour, the airport is ""full"".
Being able to use both runways could increase the number of departures by 50,000 a year by the end of the 2030s, the airport argued.
It said some 30,000 of those flights are planned to depart from the north runway which will only be used for departures and not landings.
But there is strong opposition to any expansion, particularly from climate campaigners.
Greenpeace UK policy director Douglas Parr said the extension would not drive economic growth. ""The only thing it's set to boost is air pollution, noise, and climate emissions,"" he added.
Alex Chapman, senior economist at left-of-centre think tank New Economics Foundation, also argued the move would not create new jobs, but would just shift them from other parts of the country.
""People are already perfectly able to catch cheap flights on holiday or travel for business,"" he added.
Union Unite general secretary Sharon Graham backed Gatwick having a second runway, but warned it would need ""to come with guarantees of well paid, unionised jobs and proper facilities for workers"".
Bronwen Jones, development director at Gatwick, said a second runway would be ""a win for everyone"".
She said it would create more flight slots across both runways.
""That allows us to offer new routes, new airlines, more frequencies on existing routes, so that passengers have more choice.""
Sally Pavey, chair of Communities Against Gatwick Noise Emissions (CAGNE), is worried about ""uncontrollable noise, ramifications on the roads, decline in air quality... and climate change"".
""We can't keep ignoring climate change and it would be wrong to allow a new 'bucket and spade' runway, as we put it, at the expense of residents and the economy,"" she said.
The group would take legal action through a judicial review if the expansion goes ahead, she added.
Gatwick said it has committed to reducing noise levels to below those of 2019 - which CAGNE says was one of the worst years for noise.
On Wednesday the government's independent advisers, the UK climate change committee (UKCCC), recommended that to meet the country's climate goals the amount of planet-warming gases released by the country's aviation sector needed to fall by 17% compared to 2003 levels.
Some of the pollution from flying, it said, could be reduced by switching planes to sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) and by capturing the planet-warming gases released.
But experts think it could be challenging to obtain the feedstock, like corn grain or food waste, needed to make SAF.
The UKCCC said the best way to reduce the industry's impact on climate change would be to significantly slow the demand for flying.
At current levels demand is expected to grow by 53% by 2040, while the UKCCC says this should be closer to 16%.

'Pilot confusion' led to serious airport incident,"An investigation into a serious incident involving a plane attempting to land in fog found ""confusion and miscommunication"" between the crew.
A Jump Air flight from Southampton was on the approach to Guernsey Airport in August when it descended below the minimum height allowed during poor visibility.
The report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) found there was confusion between the pilot and co-pilot which resulted in delays to the plane making a climb.
It then diverted and landed safely back at Southampton Airport.
The AAIB said the operator had taken a number of safety actions since the incident.
Guernsey airline Aurigny said the flight was being operated by Jump Air - an aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance (ACMI) or ""wet lease"" provider.
A spokesman said this was commonplace and typically used by airlines to increase capacity during peak periods or when its fleet capacity is impacted.
It added: ""We are encouraged by the report findings that Jump Air has implemented a number of changes since the incident.
""We are very glad all those involved are safe and the safety and welfare of our customers and crew is always our priority. We will work closely with regulatory bodies and ACMI operators accordingly.""

£50k reward for 'great' artist Orlik's missing works,"A re-discovered artist described as a ""great"" is offering a £50,000 reward in the search for dozens of his missing works.
Henry Orlik, 78, from Swindon, has made £1.6m from his surrealist art work in the past year, with all the sales coming from two exhibitions.
While he had work displayed beside the likes of Salvador Dali in the 1970s, Orlik became an artistic recluse some decades ago and is now in poor health.
After being evicted from his social housing in London while recovering from a stroke in 2022, his possessions - including a large amount of his work - disappeared, and the search is on to find them.
Orlick currently lives in his childhood home in Swindon, where other works had been safely stored.
Family friend Jan Pietruszka said he had been sorting through them, with some items going to the recent exhibitions for sale.
He said Orlik remained desperate to find the missing works lost during his eviction and ""my brief is find them at all cost"".
""He's getting weaker all the time. His health situation is deteriorating. He's quite depressed that we're not making great progress in finding these paintings,"" he explained.
Mr Pietruszka said his friend struggled to speak much now.
""He's very deprecating about his work,"" he added.
""When it comes to the money side, he's ambivalent, he's not really interested. The subject always reverts back to, 'Can you get the paintings back?'.""

It was initially thought that 78 works had been lost when Orlick was evicted from his London flat and could not get back inside.
Now, it is believed at least 90 pieces - potentially hundreds - are missing.
The £50,000 reward is for the recovery of all the pieces, as there has still been no confirmation of their whereabouts.
Some of the artwork is enormous - life size or larger and already on a frame - and would be easily noticed as a result.
Interpretations of Marilyn Monroe were among them.
""Nobody in their right mind would throw that in the skip,"" said Mr Pietruszka.
Hundreds of sketches and work laid out flat were in an architects chest that was in the London home too, including several of his own copies of the Mona Lisa.
A lot of Orlik's work is not signed, but one of his specialisms is something called ""excitations"", his method of composing a picture using small squiggles.
Orlik paints with incredible accuracy and tiny brush strokes, but has mastered different styles.
Marlborough art dealer and gallery owner Grant Ford has been working with Mr Pietruszka and organising the exhibitions.
He said he could hardly believe what he was seeing when one of Orlik's works was first put in front of him.
""I've never come across an artist quite like this,"" he said. ""As a specialist, I think his imagination is extraordinary.""
Mr Ford has three decades of experience at Sotheby's and can be seen as an expert on the BBC's Antiques Roadshow.
He said that Orlik ""should be considered one of our greats"".
""I think had he not turned his back on the commercial art world in the 70s, he would have been one of the really big names.
""Now is a critical time because his health is deteriorating,"" said Mr Ford.

Mr Ford said they had had interest from all over the world, including the US and China.
As a young man, Orlik spent some time in New York in the 1970s and an exhibition is being organised there for this year.
Due to Orlik's art not being sold for decades, the gallery owner had to start from scratch in working out how to price them.
Some have gone for more than £40,000.
Mr Ford and Mr Pietruszka said they were determined to find the bulk of the missing work with this reward - not just one or two pieces.
Anyone with information about the works' whereabouts has been urged to contact the Winsor Birch gallery.

"Artist's double-sided painting fetches £162,500","A two-sided painting by a renowned East Anglian artist has sold at auction for more than double its estimated value.
Cambridge-based auctioneers Cheffins said the Cedric Morris artwork, which had never been sold on the open market before, fetched £162,500 and showed the artist's ""continued popularity"".
Morris (1889-1982), who founded the East Anglian School of Painting & Drawing in Essex before moving it to Suffolk, was believed to have finished the artwork in the 1930s before gifting it to his student, Bettina Shaw-Lawrence.
The oil on canvas, which featured a floral landscape on one side and rural building on the reverse, was sold to a London-based bidder on Thursday.
The auction was the first time the painting had been available on the open market.
It followed Cheffins' previous auction of another Morris which had been gifted to fellow artist Lucy Harwoodwork.
The other side depicted outbuildings at the art school at Benton End, near Hadleigh in Suffolk, which had relocated from Dedham in Essex after a fire.
Morris ran the private art school with fellow painter Arthur Lett-Haines. Aldeburgh Scallop sculptor Maggi Hambling was one of their pupils.
Brett Tryner, a director at Cheffins said: ""This is an excellent result and demonstrates Morris's continued popularity as one of the most sought-after artists in the post-modern era.
""The paintings enviable provenance, having been gifted directly by Morris to Bettina Shaw-Lawrence, helped to ensure this painting had some serious pre-sale interest, with inquiries from both private buyers and institutions the world over.
""Perfectly demonstrating the period in Morris's career when he produced some of his most wonderful still-life pictures, this painting was unusual to have firstly been fresh-to-market, but also to have another view painted on the reverse.""
The landscape paintings were given to Cheffins to auction by the Shaw-Lawrence family.
Mr Tryner said Bettina Shaw-Lawrence had been a well-regarded artist herself and initially attended art classes by the painter Fernand Léger in 1938.

Artist recreates childhood home landmarks in Lego,"An artist has been recreating landmarks of her hometown using Lego.
Kaz Taplin, who now lives in Australia, has been reconnecting with Henley on Thames in Oxfordshire by creating models of places including Gabriel Machin butchers shop and the town hall.
She works off old photographs, as well as new ones she takes when she visits her family.
Mrs Taplin said using her memories for the models was ""very inspirational"" and that it brought her ""close to home"".
She said they had moved 17 years ago from Gainsborough Crescent in Henley to the coastal city of Mandurah in Australia where they built a house.
""But I go back every few years (...) because family have passed away, so it's to respect that or to see the children (...) and the grandchildren,"" Mrs Taplin added.
The places that she chose to build Lego models of are ""part of our childhood"".
""Mum used to take us to the shops and pick up stuff, I've done a Bagatelle toy shop that's full of toys,"" she said.
""The library used to be in the town hall, so we used to go and pick up books.""
Mrs Taplin said the town hall had taken her a week to construct, and the roof had fallen apart in the process.
""But as I've been doing more and more, it's just [been taking] a few days on and off.""
She said she is now recreating a Wimpy restaurant.
""My dad used to take us into the Wimpy on Saturdays to have a burger.
""I've not quite finished that one yet, but it's very inspirational and close to home.""
Mrs Taplin said she had received ""absolutely amazing"" feedback on her work.
""I didn't think it would be like this. I'm just doing it because I like my hometown.""
The models are currently displayed on a shelf in one of her spare rooms.
Mrs Taplin said she had also completed commissioned paintings of other local landmarks such as the Henley Villa.

Blampied paintings sell for more than £37k,"A rare collection of paintings by Jersey artist, Edmund Blampied, have been sold at auction for more than £37,000.
Six individual lots went under the hammer at Dawsons Auctioneers in Jersey, with the most expensive painting, ""Seaweed Harvesting, Jersey"" selling for £13,000.
The collection was previously on display at Government House when Admiral Sir Randolph Stewart Gresham Nicholson served as Jersey's Lieutenant-Governor.
Jonathan Pratt, managing director of Dawsons Auctioneers, said it was ""a privilege to bring such a special collection to auction.""
The auction house said Edmund Blampied, who died in 1966, was widely regarded as Jersey's ""most renowned artist"" and was celebrated for his ability to ""capture the essence of island life with charm, character, and a deep sense of place.""
The artworks for sale included some of Mr Blampied's ""most evocative depictions of Jersey life"", it said.
Lot 10, a watercolour titled ""Peeling Potatoes"" was sold along with a letter from the artist to its previous owner for £5,500.
The letter read: ""Dear Lady Nicholson, the old lady peeling potatoes must be, I am sure, feeling so greatly honoured at being in Government House – but at the same time wishing most desperately that she had on a cleaner apron and the hat especially reserved for Sundays which is fitted with black grapes, ribbon and a kingfisher…""
Some of the other works in the sale included ""Surf Riders"" and ""Vraicking, Jersey; Study of Flowers (verso)"", which sold for £11,000 and £7,500 respectively.

Theatre could close after funding cut - councillor,"A councillor has warned that a county could lose its biggest theatre if a planned funding cut goes ahead.
The Royal and Derngate in Northampton is set to lose £30,000 of its grant from West Northamptonshire Council.
Dennis Meredith, a Liberal Democrat member of the authority, told councillors: ""Every year, you pick on the Derngate.""
The council said it ""greatly valued"" the venue but had to ""make difficult decisions"".
The Royal, a traditional repertory theatre, opened in 1884. The Derngate, a modern flexible auditorium, staged its first performance next door almost a hundred years later.
They were merged into one complex in 2005.
West Northamptonshire Council's budget for the next financial year, which was agreed last week, included a measure to cut £30,000 from the venue's £300,000 subsidy.
Meredith, a former Mayor of Northampton, said he was ""quite horrified"" by the proposal and said the theatre was putting on plays ""on a shoestring"".
He told the Conservative-controlled council: ""Every single year, you pick on the Derngate.
""If you're not careful, we're going to lose the Derngate, and that is a fact.""
A spokesperson for the Royal and Derngate said: ""Annual grant funding from both Arts Council England and West Northamptonshire Council contributes an important 15% of annual income at Royal and Derngate, with the theatre earning the remaining 85% from tickets sales, bars sales and other activities.
""Any decrease in funding is always of concern but we are very grateful for the ongoing support of our stakeholders and funders who help us to continue delivering the level of work of which we are so proud.""
West Northamptonshire Council said: ""We greatly value the Royal and Derngate and the contribution they make to West Northamptonshire.
""However, like all councils nationally, we have had to make difficult decisions to deliver savings across all non-essential services so we can balance the book for taxpayers.""
A spokesperson said the £30,000 reduction reflected its ""continued financial challenges"".

Sites sought for Ukranian bombed door sculpture,"An artist who has created a sculpture using the door of a bombed home in Ukraine is appealing for places display it.
Robert Marshall from Wareham, Dorset, salvaged the door, which is covered in scorch marks from the heat of a blast and has a hole blown through it, from Toretsk.
The conceptual and environmental sculptor said he chose the door as it represents the ""safety and security"" people have at home, and he wanted to draw attention to the fact that families had lost this during Russia's full-scale invasion.
Mr Marshall is looking for venues or outside spaces around the UK to display the sculpture, which has been mounted on a pile of rubble.
He said: ""I had the idea to try and get a door three years ago to tell the plight of all the people that are suffering"".
Unable to travel to the war zone himself, Mr Marshall got in touch with soldiers in Toretsk, via a Ukranian refugee in Swanage.
He said the door was pulled from the rubble of the city home where 30,000 people used to live during a lull in the fighting ""now there is no one left it is a complete bomb site.""
After getting a courier to ship the door, he said when it arrived at his home he decided to leave it just as it is.
He said: ""This door just said everything... to do anything to it would detract from its message.""
When it goes on show to the public, Mr Marshall said he planned to add stories of Ukrainian families to the artwork.
""I wish it to be a monument to all the innocent casualties of war. I hope it to be a voice for all the refugees,"" he said.
Tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians have died since Russia launched its full-scale invasion three years ago, while large swathes of Ukraine have been destroyed.

Abuse survivors' art is 'relief from a monster',"Art created by domestic abuse survivors in Wiltshire will go on display next month in an exhibition called The Next Chapter.
""I was able to feel a sense of relief from the pain I suffered at the hands of a monster,"" one contributor said.
The exhibition will include paintings, drawings and poems, with smartphones and headphones to listen to stories behind them.
Organisations FearFree, GreenSquareAccord, Julian House, The Nelson Trust and Collaborate Digital have worked with the Wiltshire Council for the event.
The survivors who have contributed have been through domestic abuse support in Wiltshire - the art and creativity contributed towards therapy and recovery.
One woman who produced art for the exhibition said: ""With the art I created, I expressed my emotions and I was able to feel a sense of relief from the pain I suffered at the hands of a monster.
""I put the brush in the black paint, it just happened from there, I did not know what I was painting.
""It came from the heart. I want people to see my work and understand that domestic abuse is a serious matter.
""I am looking forward to [people] seeing the art and get them to imagine what life is like in an abusive relationship.""
Diana, who works for the charity Julian House, added: ""It's remarkable to witness the transformation of the women who were once denied the simple joy of painting due to their coercive circumstances now embracing art as a tool for healing and empowerment.""
The exhibition will also feature podcasts produced by students from Wiltshire schools during healthy relationship workshops run by Collaborate Digital.
Cllr Ian Blair-Pilling, Wiltshire Council's Cabinet Member for Public Health, said: ""The Next Chapter is not just an art exhibition, but a celebration of survival and strength and we're pleased we could help people share their stories with the public to raise awareness of domestic abuse.""
The exhibition hosted by Wiltshire Council at County Hall in Trowbridge will run on 4 and 5 March, with the opening day including performances from a female vocal choir.

Keith Flint mural to be restored to former glory,"A mural made in memory of Prodigy singer Keith Flint will undergo a makeover, to restore it to its original condition.
The artwork was produced by David 'Gnasher' Nash in honour of Flint, 49, who was the dance act's frontman until his death in March 2019.
Depicting the singer with his trademark pierced tongue sticking out, the artwork was spray-painted on to a water tank at Braintree Town FC, close to where he lived.
But more than five years on, the mural has been showing signs of wear - so Mr Nash is returning to the RBMC Stadium on Thursday to ""spruce up"" the design, ahead of the sixth anniversary of Flint's death.
""I follow Braintree Town FC online so I've seen pictures of the mural popping up all the time, and I have seen it is flaking off a bit here and there,"" said Mr Nash.
""But I don't think it needs that much TLC and I am hoping it will take two to three hours max.
""I am pretty optimistic and it just feels like the right time to get it done.""
Street artist Mr Nash was enlisted to produce the mural by the club, after Flint was found dead at his Essex home on 4 March 2019.
The commemorative piece has since been seen by hundreds of fans, while the group's number one hit Firestarter gets played at home matches.
""There were a few little bits on the mural that I was not happy with, so I might take them out and I might put some more detail in it,"" added Mr Nash.
""It was five-and-a-half years ago, so hopefully I've got better since then, so maybe I will tweak it a bit and sharpen it up, but overall I was quite happy with it.""
During the event Mr Nash will be joined by Fay Greaves, known for her appearance on The Traitors, who will be representing Ripple Suicide Prevention.
A spokesperson for Braintree Town said: ""This Thursday, David 'Gnasher' Nash returns to Braintree to spruce up our popular Keith Flint mural.
""Understandably, the mural is showing signs of wear [but] Gnasher is returning to smarten the water tank up and bring the mural back to the condition it was in in 2019.""

New roof to protect 'much-loved' theatre,"Work to replace the roof of a theatre is expected to finish in March, officials have said.
The Plowright Theatre, Scunthorpe, was built in 1958, but a recent survey found the existing roof had reached the end of its lifespan.
North Lincolnshire Council, which owns the building, said it could no longer continue with patchwork repairs due to the risk of leaks damaging the auditorium, performance equipment and other parts of the interior.
The £160,000 funding for the project has come from the government's Shared Prosperity Fund.
The venue, which is named in honour of the late actress Dame Joan Plowright, has been described by the council as an ""essential part of Scunthorpe's entertainment scene"".
Councillor John Davison, cabinet member for culture, heritage and arts, said: ""This investment is fantastic news for the Plowright Theatre and for the local community.
""By replacing part of the roof now, we are protecting this much-loved venue and ensuring it remains a vibrant space for live performances in North Lincolnshire.""
